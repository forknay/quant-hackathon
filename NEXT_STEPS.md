# Next Steps: Immediate Action Plan

## Executive Summary

You have a solid foundation with:
- ✅ **Complete data cleaning pipeline** (sophisticated, production-ready)
- ✅ **Layer 1 prototype** (utilities sector with MA/MOM/GARCH)
- ✅ **ML and portfolio templates** (need integration)
- ❌ **Missing**: Other sectors, integration, text processing, meta-learning

## Immediate Priority Actions (Next 2 Weeks)

### Week 1: Fix & Scale Layer 1

**Day 1-2: Fix Critical Issues**
```bash
# 1. Update utilities config
cd algorithm/utilities/
# Edit config.py: MIN_TRAIN=250 → 500, add MAX_TRAIN_WINDOW=750
# Add candidate selection parameters (see TECHNICAL_RECOMMENDATIONS.md)

# 2. Test current pipeline
python pipeline.py  # Verify utilities still works with fixes
```

**Day 3-7: Implement All Sectors**
```bash
# Create sector configurations (copy utilities/ template)
mkdir -p algorithm/{financials,it,healthcare,industrials,materials,energy,re,telecoms,cons_staples,cons_discretionary}

# Priority order (implement in this sequence):
# 1. IT (45) - cyclical, different parameters  
# 2. Financials (40) - large sector
# 3. Healthcare (35) - defensive
# 4. Others as time permits
```

**Expected Deliverable**: All 11 sectors producing monthly candidate selections

### Week 2: Data Integration Pipeline

**Day 8-10: Build Monthly Aggregation**
```bash
# Create unified monthly data pipeline
mkdir layer1_integration/
# Implement monthly aggregation across all sectors
# Output: monthly_candidates_YYYY_MM.parquet files
```

**Day 11-14: Layer 2 Integration**
```bash
# Modify penalized_linear_hackathon.py to:
# 1. Load Layer 1 candidates (not all stocks)
# 2. Add Layer 1 signals as features
# 3. Implement proper temporal validation
```

**Expected Deliverable**: End-to-end pipeline from raw data → Layer 1 → Layer 2 predictions

## Medium-term Roadmap (Weeks 3-8)

### Weeks 3-4: Enhanced ML Framework
- Implement ensemble methods (XGBoost/LightGBM)
- Add feature importance tracking
- Implement rolling validation with proper gaps
- Calculate OOS R² using competition definition

### Weeks 5-6: Portfolio Construction & Risk Management  
- Enhanced portfolio construction with risk constraints
- Sector neutrality and position size limits
- Volatility targeting and turnover optimization
- Comprehensive performance attribution

### Weeks 7-8: Layer 3 Text Processing (Optional)
- 10-K/10-Q filing processing pipeline
- FinBERT embeddings and sentiment analysis
- CIK ↔ gvkey mapping and temporal alignment
- Integration with Layer 2 features

## Code Quality & Architecture

### Immediate Improvements Needed:
1. **Fix GARCH parameters**: MIN_TRAIN too small, missing MAX_TRAIN_WINDOW
2. **Add candidate selection**: Currently only computing indicators, not selecting
3. **Memory optimization**: Large datasets need chunking and caching
4. **Temporal validation**: Prevent data leakage in ML pipeline

### Architectural Decisions:
- **Unified configuration**: Use dataclass-based configs for all sectors
- **Layered caching**: Monthly aggregation between layers
- **Modular design**: Each layer as independent module with clear interfaces
- **Comprehensive testing**: Unit tests for core functions, integration tests for pipeline

## Success Metrics & Validation

### Technical Validation:
- [ ] All 11 sectors produce consistent monthly candidates
- [ ] No data leakage in temporal splits (strict t → t+1 prediction)
- [ ] Memory usage < 16GB for full backtest
- [ ] Runtime < 4 hours for complete pipeline

### Model Performance Targets:
- [ ] OOS R² > 0.5% (vs zero benchmark)
- [ ] Long-short portfolio Sharpe ratio > 1.0
- [ ] Maximum drawdown < 15%
- [ ] Monthly turnover < 50%

## Risk Management

### Key Risks:
1. **Data leakage**: Most critical - can invalidate entire competition entry
2. **Overfitting**: Too many parameters relative to data
3. **Implementation bugs**: Incorrect date handling, wrong data alignment
4. **Performance degradation**: Model works in backtest but fails in production

### Mitigation Strategies:
- Implement automated data leakage detection
- Use conservative hyperparameter tuning with long hold-out periods
- Comprehensive unit testing and code review
- Walk-forward validation with multiple time periods

## Resources & Tools

### Recommended Development Setup:
```bash
# Install enhanced requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up development environment
mkdir -p {cache,results,logs,tests}
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:$(pwd)"

# Configure logging and monitoring
# Set up automated testing pipeline
```

### Monitoring & Debugging:
- Implement comprehensive logging for all pipeline stages  
- Add performance monitoring and memory usage tracking
- Create automated data quality checks
- Set up backtesting validation framework

## Final Deliverables Timeline

**Month 1**: Layer 1 complete for all sectors, Layer 2 integrated
**Month 2**: Portfolio construction optimized, Layer 3 text processing
**Month 3**: Meta-learning, final validation, competition submission

## Questions for Clarification

1. **Data availability**: Do you have access to the 10-K/10-Q text data (~30GB)?
2. **Computational resources**: What are memory/CPU constraints for development?
3. **Timeline flexibility**: Is there flexibility in the competition deadline?
4. **Sector prioritization**: Which sectors are most important if time is limited?

**Start here**: Fix utilities config.py and test current pipeline, then scale to other sectors. The foundation is solid - execution is now the key.
