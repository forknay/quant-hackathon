REAL_1045_01_rf_2023_0001,1045,01,1045:01,"Item 1A. Risk Factors28 Item 1A. Risk Factors, ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSBelow are certain risk factors that may affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, or the trading price of our common stock or other securities. We caution the reader that these risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risks and uncertainties, nor can it assess the extent to which any of the risk factors below or any such new risks and uncertainties, or any combination thereof, may impact our business.Risks Related to our Business and IndustryDownturns in economic conditions could adversely affect our business. Due to the discretionary nature of business and leisure travel spending and the highly competitive nature of the airline industry, our revenues are heavily influenced by the condition of the U.S. economy and economies in other regions of the world. Unfavorable conditions in these broader economies have resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased passenger demand for air travel, changes in booking practices and related reactions by our competitors, all of which in turn have had, and may have in the future, a strong negative effect on our business. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic and associated decline in economic activity and increase in unemployment levels had a severe and prolonged effect on the global economy generally and, in turn, resulted in a prolonged period of depressed demand for air travel. In addition, a rapid economic expansion following the height of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant inflationary pressures and volatility in certain currencies, which have increased our costs for aircraft fuel, wages and benefits and other goods and services we require to operate our business, as well as increasing the interest expense on our variable-rate indebtedness.We will need to obtain sufficient financing or other capital to operate successfully.Our business plan contemplates continued significant investments related to our fleet, improving the experience of our customers and updating our facilities. Significant capital resources will be required to execute this plan. We estimate that, based on our commitments as of December 31, 2022, our planned aggregate expenditures for aircraft purchase commitments and certain engines on a consolidated basis for calendar years 2023 through 2027 would be approximately $12.3 billion. We may also require financing to refinance maturing obligations and to provide liquidity to fund other corporate requirements. Accordingly, we will need substantial liquidity, financing or other capital resources to finance such aircraft and engines and meet such other liquidity needs. If needed, it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all, due to, among other factors: our substantial level of existing indebtedness, particularly following the additional liquidity transactions completed in response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; our non-investment grade credit rating; volatile or otherwise unfavorable market conditions; and the availability of assets to use as collateral for loans or other indebtedness, which has been reduced significantly as a result of certain financing transactions we have undertaken since the beginning of 2020 and may be further reduced. If we are unable to arrange any such required financing at customary advance rates and on terms and conditions acceptable to us, we may need to use cash from operations or cash on hand to purchase aircraft and engines or fund our other corporate requirements, or may seek to negotiate deferrals for such aircraft and engines with the applicable manufacturers or otherwise defer corporate obligations. Depending on numerous factors applicable at the time we seek capital, many of which are out of our control, such as the state of the domestic and global economies, the capital and credit markets’ view of our prospects and the airline industry in general, and the general availability of debt and equity capital, the financing or other capital resources that we will need may not be available to us, or may be available only on onerous terms and conditions. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining financing or other needed sources of capital to operate successfully or to fund our committed expenditures. An inability to obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms would limit our ability to execute necessary capital projects and would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.28Table of ContentsOur high level of debt and other obligations may limit our ability to fund general corporate requirements and obtain additional financing, may limit our flexibility in responding to competitive developments and may cause our business to be vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions.We have significant amounts of indebtedness and other financial obligations, including pension obligations, obligations to make future payments on flight equipment and property leases related to airport and other facilities, and substantial non-cancelable obligations under aircraft and related spare engine purchase agreements. Moreover, currently a very significant portion of our assets are pledged to secure our indebtedness. Our substantial indebtedness and other obligations, which are generally greater than the indebtedness and other obligations of our competitors, could have important consequences. For example, they may:•make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness;•limit our ability to obtain additional funding for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments and general corporate purposes, and adversely affect the terms on which such funding can be obtained;•require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our liquidity or cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness and other obligations, thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes;•make us more vulnerable to economic downturns, industry conditions and catastrophic external events, particularly relative to competitors with lower relative levels of financial leverage;•significantly constrain our ability to respond, or respond quickly, to unexpected disruptions in our own operations, the U.S. or global economies, or the businesses in which we operate, or to take advantage of opportunities that would improve our business, operations, or competitive position versus other airlines;•limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions;•bear interest at floating rates, subjecting us to volatility in interest expenses as interest rates fluctuate;•contain covenants requiring us to maintain an aggregate of at least $2.0 billion of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and amounts available to be drawn under revolving credit facilities and collateral coverage ratios and peak debt service coverage ratios; and•contain restrictive covenants that could, among other things:◦limit our ability to merge, consolidate, sell assets, incur additional indebtedness, issue preferred stock, make investments and pay dividends; and◦if breached, result in an event of default under our indebtedness.In addition, since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic we have been required to obtain a significant amount of additional financing from a variety of sources and we cannot guarantee that we will not need to obtain additional financing in the future. Such financing may include the issuance of additional unsecured or secured debt securities, equity securities and equity-linked securities as well as additional bilateral and syndicated secured and/or unsecured credit facilities, among other items. There can be no assurance as to the timing of any such financing transactions, which may be in the near term, or that we will be able to obtain such additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. Any such actions may be material in nature, could result in the incurrence and issuance of significant additional indebtedness or equity and could impose significant covenants and restrictions to which we are not currently subject. In particular, in connection with the financial assistance we have received through the payroll support program established under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) (PSP1), the payroll support program established under the Subtitle A of Title IV of Division N of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (PSP Extension Law) (PSP2) and the payroll support program established under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARP) (PSP3), we are required to comply with the relevant provisions of the CARES Act, the PSP Extension Law and the ARP, respectively, including the requirement that funds provided pursuant to PSP1, PSP2 and PSP3 be used exclusively for the continuation of payment of eligible employee wages, salaries and benefits; and restrictions on the payment of certain executive compensation until April 1, 2023. Additionally, under PSP1, PSP2 and PSP3, we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to substantial and continuing reporting obligations. The substance and duration of these restrictions may materially affect our operations, and we may not be successful in managing these impacts. Moreover, as a result of the financing activities we undertook in response to 29Table of Contentsthe COVID-19 pandemic, the number of financings with respect to which such covenants and provisions apply has increased, thereby subjecting us to more substantial risk of cross-default and cross-acceleration in the event of breach, and additional covenants and provisions could become binding on us as we continue to seek additional liquidity. The obligations discussed above, including those imposed as a result of the CARES Act, the PSP Extension Law, the ARP and any additional financings we may be required to undertake, could also impact our ability to obtain additional financing, if needed, and our flexibility in the conduct of our business, and could materially adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.Further, a substantial amount of our long-term indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating interest rates, primarily based on the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) for deposits of U.S. dollars. LIBOR tends to fluctuate based on general short-term interest rates, rates set by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks, the supply of and demand for credit in the London interbank market and general economic conditions. We have not hedged our interest rate exposure with respect to our floating rate debt. Accordingly, our interest expense for any particular period will fluctuate based on LIBOR and other variable interest rates. In 2022, in response to rising inflation which coincided with a rapid rebound of economic activity as governments lifted restrictions and economies reopened following the COVID-19 pandemic, central banks around the world—including the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England—commenced a cycle of raising interest rates, which has consequently increased the interest we pay on our floating-rate indebtedness. To the extent the interest rates applicable to our floating rate debt increase, our interest expense will increase, in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs, and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected. On July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The discontinuation date for submission and publication of rates for certain tenors of USD LIBOR (1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month) was subsequently extended by the ICE Benchmark Administration (the administrator of LIBOR) until June 30, 2023. It is not possible to predict what rate or rates may become the predominant alternative to LIBOR, or what effect these changes in views or alternatives may have on financial markets for LIBOR-linked financial instruments. While the U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, has chosen the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), and specifically Term SOFR, as the recommended risk-free reference rate for the U.S. (calculated based on repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities), we cannot currently predict the extent to which this index will gain widespread acceptance as a replacement for LIBOR. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the United Kingdom, the United States or elsewhere. See also the discussion of interest rate risk in Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – “Interest.”As of December 31, 2022, we had $9.2 billion of borrowings with interest rates linked to LIBOR. We have commenced the process of amending our LIBOR-based financing agreements to transition them to successor reference rates in anticipation of LIBOR’s discontinuation, but we may not be able to reach agreements with all affected lenders, or to do so on favorable terms. Additionally, the replacement of LIBOR with a comparable or successor rate could cause the amount of interest payable on our long-term debt to be different or higher than expected.We have significant pension and other postretirement benefit funding obligations, which may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.Our pension funding obligations are significant. The amount of our pension funding obligations will depend on the performance of investments held in trust by the pension plans, interest rates for determining liabilities and actuarial experience. We also have significant obligations for retiree medical and other postretirement benefits. Additionally, we participate in the IAM National Pension Fund (the IAM Pension Fund). The funding status of the IAM Pension Fund is subject to the risk that other employers may not meet their obligations, which under certain circumstances could cause our obligations to increase. On March 29, 2019, the actuary for the IAM Pension Fund certified that the fund was in “endangered” status despite reporting a funded status of over 80%. Additionally, the IAM Pension Fund’s Board voluntarily elected to enter into “critical” status on April 17, 2019. Upon entry into critical status, the IAM Pension Fund was required by law to adopt a rehabilitation plan aimed at restoring the financial health of the pension plan and did so on April 17, 2019 (the Rehabilitation Plan). Under the Rehabilitation Plan, American was subject to an immaterial contribution surcharge, which ceased to apply June 14, 2019 upon American’s mandatory adoption of a contribution schedule under the Rehabilitation Plan. The contribution schedule requires 2.5% annual increases to its contribution rate. This contribution schedule will remain in effect through the earlier of December 31, 2031 or the date the IAM Pension Fund emerges from critical status. Furthermore, if we were to withdraw from the IAM Pension Fund, if the 30Table of ContentsIAM Pension fund were to terminate, or if the IAM Pension Fund were to undergo a mass withdrawal, we could be subject to liability as imposed by law.If our financial condition worsens, provisions in our credit card processing and other commercial agreements may adversely affect our liquidity.We have agreements with companies that process customer credit card transactions for the sale of air travel and other services. These agreements allow these credit card processing companies, under certain conditions (including, with respect to certain agreements, our failure to maintain certain levels of liquidity), to hold an amount of our cash (referred to as a holdback) equal to some or all of the advance ticket sales that have been processed by that credit card processor, but for which we have not yet provided the air transportation. Additionally, such credit card processing companies may require cash or other collateral reserves to be established. These credit card processing companies are not currently entitled to maintain any holdbacks pursuant to these requirements. These holdback requirements can be implemented at the discretion of the credit card processing companies upon the occurrence of specific events, including material adverse changes in our financial condition or the triggering of a liquidity covenant. The imposition of holdback requirements, up to and including 100% of relevant advanced ticket sales, would materially reduce our liquidity. Likewise, other of our commercial agreements contain provisions that allow other counterparties to impose less-favorable terms, including the acceleration of amounts due, in the event of material adverse changes in our financial condition. For example, we maintain certain letters of credit, insurance- and surety-related agreements under which counterparties may require collateral, including cash collateral.The loss of key personnel upon whom we depend to operate our business or the inability to attract and develop additional qualified personnel could adversely affect our business.We believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to attract, develop and retain highly qualified management, technical and other personnel. Retaining and recruiting people with the appropriate skills is particularly challenging as the economy in general, and the airline industry in particular, continue to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in competition for the human resources necessary to operate our business successfully. We may not be successful in attracting, developing or retaining key personnel or other highly qualified personnel. Among other things, the CARES Act, the PSP Extension Law and the ARP impose significant restrictions on executive compensation, which will remain in place until April 1, 2023. Such restrictions, over time, will likely result in lower executive compensation in the airline industry than is prevailing in other industries, creating increasing retention challenges in the case of executives presented with alternative, non-airline opportunities. In addition, competition for skilled personnel has intensified and may continue to intensify if overall industry capacity continues to increase and/or we were to incur attrition at levels higher than we have historically. Any inability to attract, develop and retain significant numbers of qualified management and other personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our business has been and will continue to be affected by many changing economic and other conditions beyond our control, including global events that affect travel behavior, and our results of operations could be volatile and fluctuate due to seasonality. Our business, results of operations and financial condition have been and will continue to be affected by many changing economic and other conditions beyond our control, including, among others:•actual or potential changes in international, national, regional and local economic, business and financial conditions, including recession, inflation and higher interest rates;•the occurrence of wars, terrorist attacks and political instability;•changes in consumer preferences, perceptions, spending patterns and demographic trends;•changes in the competitive environment due to industry consolidation, changes in airline alliance affiliations and other factors;•actual or potential disruptions to the U.S. National Airspace System (the ATC system);•increases in costs of safety, security and environmental measures;•outbreaks of diseases that affect travel behavior, such as occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic; and31Table of Contents•weather and natural disasters, including increases in frequency, severity or duration of such disasters, and related costs caused by more severe weather due to climate change.The COVID-19 pandemic, along with the measures governments and private organizations worldwide implemented in an attempt to contain its spread, resulted in significant volatility in demand for air travel, which adversely affected our business, operations and financial condition to an unprecedented extent and for a prolonged period. Measures implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic—such as travel restrictions, including testing regimes, “stay at home” and quarantine orders, limitations on public gatherings, cancellation of public events and many others—initially resulted in a precipitous decline in demand for both domestic and international business and leisure travel. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated changes in business practices which may persist. For example, businesses and other travelers may continue to forego air travel in favor of remote or flexible working policies and communication alternatives such as videoconferencing. In addition, businesses may seek to reduce travel costs by requiring the purchase of less expensive tickets, thereby potentially impacting our average revenue per available seat mile. In response to this material deterioration in demand, we took a number of aggressive actions to ameliorate the impacts to our business, operations and financial condition. While cases have declined globally and many governments have loosened or lifted COVID-related travel restrictions, the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic—including the emergence and spread of any new variants—and its after effects remain uncertain, and there can be no assurance that any mitigating actions we take in response will be sufficient to avert a deterioration in our business, financial condition and results of operations.In addition to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, an outbreak of another contagious disease—such as has occurred in the past with the Ebola virus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, H1N1 influenza virus, avian flu, Zika virus or any other similar illness—if it were to become associated with air travel or persist for an extended period, could materially affect the airline industry and us by reducing revenues and adversely impacting our operations and passengers’ travel behavior. As a result of these or other conditions beyond our control, our results of operations could be volatile and subject to rapid and unexpected change. In addition, due to generally weaker demand for air travel during the winter, our revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year could be weaker than revenues in the second and third quarters of the year.Union disputes, employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions, or our inability to otherwise maintain labor costs at competitive levels and hire and retain a sufficient number of employees may adversely affect our operations and financial performance.Relations between air carriers and labor unions in the U.S. are governed by the RLA. Under the RLA, CBAs generally contain “amendable dates” rather than expiration dates, and the RLA requires that a carrier maintain the existing terms and conditions of employment following the amendable date through a multi-stage and usually lengthy series of bargaining processes overseen by the NMB. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 87% of our employees were represented for collective bargaining purposes by labor unions, and 48% were covered by CBAs that are currently amendable or that will become amendable within one year. For the dates that the CBAs with our major work groups become amendable under the RLA, see Part I, Item 1. Business – “Our People—Labor Relations.”In the case of a CBA that is amendable under the RLA, if no agreement is reached during direct negotiations between the parties, either party may request that the NMB appoint a federal mediator. The RLA prescribes no timetable for the direct negotiation and mediation processes, and it is not unusual for those processes to last for many months or even several years. If no agreement is reached in mediation, the NMB in its discretion may declare that an impasse exists and proffer binding arbitration to the parties. Either party may decline to submit to arbitration, and if arbitration is rejected by either party, a 30-day “cooling off” period commences. During or after that period, a Presidential Emergency Board (PEB) may be established, which examines the parties’ positions and recommends a solution. The PEB process lasts for 30 days and is followed by another 30-day “cooling off” period. At the end of this “cooling off” period, unless an agreement is reached or action is taken by Congress, the labor organization may exercise “self-help,” such as a strike, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.None of the unions representing our employees presently may lawfully engage in concerted slowdowns or refusals to work, such as strikes, sick-outs or other similar activity, against us. Nonetheless, there is a risk that employees, either with or without union involvement, could engage in one or more concerted refusals to work that could individually or collectively harm the operation of our airline and impair our financial performance. Additionally, some of our unions have brought and may continue to bring grievances to binding arbitration, including those related to wages. If successful, there is a risk these arbitral avenues could result in material additional costs that we did not anticipate. See also Part I, Item 1. Business – “Our People—Labor Relations.”32Table of ContentsCurrently, we believe our labor costs are generally competitive relative to the other large network carriers. However, personnel shortages, in particular for pilots, and general wage inflation stand to impact our labor costs moving forward. Certain of our competitors have recently concluded agreements with their pilots’ unions which include significant increases in pay and benefits. We are currently in negotiations for several important new labor agreements, including with our mainline pilots, and we anticipate that any new contracts we agree with our labor groups will likewise include material increases in salaries and other benefits, which will significantly increase our labor expense.If we encounter problems with any of our third-party regional operators or third-party service providers, our operations could be adversely affected by a resulting decline in revenue or negative public perception about our services.A significant portion of our regional operations are conducted by third-party operators on our behalf, substantially all of which are provided for under capacity purchase agreements. Due to our reliance on third parties to provide these essential services, we are subject to the risk of disruptions to their operations, which has in the past and may in the future result from many of the same risk factors disclosed in this report, such as the impact of adverse economic conditions, the inability of third parties to hire or retain skilled personnel, including in particular pilots and mechanics, and other risk factors, such as an out-of-court or bankruptcy restructuring of any of our regional operators. Several of these third-party regional operators provide significant regional capacity that we would be unable to replace in a short period of time should that operator fail to perform its obligations to us. Disruptions to capital markets, shortages of pilots, mechanics and other skilled personnel and adverse economic conditions in general have subjected certain of these third-party regional operators to significant financial pressures, which have in the past and may in the future lead to bankruptcies among these operators. In particular, the severe decline in demand for air travel resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental restrictions on travel materially impacted demand for services provided by our regional carriers and, as a result, we temporarily significantly reduced our regional capacity. Further, as airlines attempt to restore capacity in line with increased demand for air travel following the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, these third-party operators have experienced difficulties in recruiting and retaining sufficient personnel to operate significantly increased schedules, and have in some instances been required to offer significant increases in pay and other benefits to recruit and retain pilots and other personnel. Ongoing volatility in travel demand has the potential to continue to adversely affect our regional operators, some of whom may experience significant financial stress, declare bankruptcy or otherwise cease to operate. We may also experience disruption to our regional operations or incur financial damages if we terminate the capacity purchase agreement with one or more of our current operators or transition the services to another provider. Any significant disruption to our regional operations would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.In addition, our reliance upon others to provide essential services on behalf of our operations may result in our relative inability to control the efficiency and timeliness of contract services. We have entered into agreements with contractors to provide various facilities and services required for our operations, including distribution and sale of airline seat inventory, reservations, provision of information technology and services, regional operations, aircraft maintenance, fueling, catering, ground services and facilities and baggage handling. Similar agreements may be entered into in any new markets we decide to serve. These agreements are generally subject to termination after notice by the third-party service provider. We are also at risk should one of these service providers cease operations, and there is no guarantee that we could replace these providers on a timely basis with comparably priced providers, or at all. These third parties are also facing challenges retaining and recruiting people with the appropriate skills to meet our requirements as the economy in general, and the airline industry in particular, continue to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic also caused significant disruption in global supply chains and staffing shortages, which have affected and may continue to affect the availability and timely delivery and fulfillment of many goods, including certain of those that we purchase directly or which are required by third parties to perform contracted services for us. We rely on the operation of complex supply chains and a large number of third parties for the procurement and fulfillment of parts, components, consumable or disposable goods and other products and services essential to our business. Following a faster than expected return of demand for air travel as COVID-19 cases declined worldwide and governments lifted travel restrictions, suppliers and many of the airports we serve experienced acute shortages of personnel, resulting in increased delays, cancellations and, in certain cases, restrictions on passenger numbers or the number of flights to or from certain airports. We cannot guarantee that, as a result of ongoing or future supply chain disruptions or staffing shortages, we, our third-party partners, or the airports we serve will be able to timely source all of the products and services we require in the course of our business, or that we will be successful in procuring suitable alternatives. Any material problems with the adequacy, efficiency and timeliness of contract services, resulting from financial hardships, personnel shortages or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.33Table of ContentsAny damage to our reputation or brand image could adversely affect our business or financial results. Maintaining a good reputation globally is critical to our business. Our reputation or brand image could be adversely impacted by, among other things, any failure to maintain high ethical, social and environmental sustainability practices for all of our operations and activities, our impact on the environment, public pressure from investors or policy groups to change our policies, such as movements to institute a “living wage,” customer perceptions of our advertising campaigns, sponsorship arrangements or marketing programs, customer perceptions of our use of social media, or customer perceptions of statements made by us, our employees and executives, agents or other third parties. In addition, we operate in a highly visible industry that has significant exposure to social media. Negative publicity, including as a result of misconduct by our customers, vendors or employees, can spread rapidly through social media. Should we not respond in a timely and appropriate manner to address negative publicity, our brand and reputation may be significantly harmed. Damage to our reputation or brand image or loss of customer confidence in our services could adversely affect our business and financial results, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation.Moreover, an outbreak and spread of an infectious disease could adversely impact consumer perceptions of the health and safety of travel, and in particular airline travel, such as occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. Actual or perceived risk of infection on our flights could have a material adverse effect on the public's perception of us and may harm our reputation and business. We have in the past, and may in the future be required to take extensive measures to reassure our team members and the traveling public of the safety of air travel, and we could incur significant costs implementing safety, hygiene-related or other actions to limit the actual or perceived threat of infection among our employees and passengers. However, we cannot assure that any actions we might take in response to an infectious disease outbreak will be sufficient to restore the confidence of consumers in the safety of air travel. In addition, as a result of mask mandates and other mitigating measures that airports and carriers were required by law to implement to limit the spread of COVID-19, we experienced an increase in the incidence of aggressive customer behavior and physical confrontation on our flights, certain of which resulted in injuries to our personnel. If our employees feel unsafe or believe that we are not doing enough to prevent and prosecute these incidents, we could experience higher rates of employee absence and we may suffer reputational harm which could make it more difficult to attract and retain employees, and which could in turn negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are at risk of losses and adverse publicity stemming from any public incident involving our company, our people or our brand, including any accident or other public incident involving our personnel or aircraft, or the personnel or aircraft of our regional, codeshare or joint business operators.We are at risk of adverse publicity stemming from any public incident involving our company, our people or our brand, particularly given the ease with which individuals can now capture and rapidly disseminate information via social media. Such an incident could involve the actual or alleged behavior of any of our employees, contractors or passengers. Further, if our personnel, one of our aircraft, a type of aircraft in our fleet, or personnel of, or an aircraft that is operated under our brand by, one of our regional operators or an airline with which we have a marketing alliance, joint business or codeshare relationship, were to be involved in a public incident, accident, catastrophe or regulatory enforcement action, we could be exposed to significant reputational harm and potential legal liability. The insurance we carry may be inapplicable or inadequate to cover any such incident, accident, catastrophe or action. In the event that our insurance is inapplicable or inadequate, we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an incident or accident. In addition, any such incident, accident, catastrophe or action involving our personnel, one of our aircraft (or personnel and aircraft of our regional operators and our codeshare partners), or a type of aircraft in our fleet could create an adverse public perception, which could harm our reputation, result in air travelers being reluctant to fly on our aircraft or those of our regional operators or codeshare partners, and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.Changes to our business model that are designed to increase revenues may not be successful and may cause operational difficulties or decreased demand.We have in the past instituted, and intend to institute in the future, changes to our business model designed to increase revenues and offset costs. These measures include further segmentation of the classes of service we offer, such as Premium Economy service and Basic Economy service, enhancements to our AAdvantage loyalty program, charging separately for services that had previously been included within the price of a ticket, changes to our practices and contracts with providers of distribution systems to provide additional content flexibility, changing (whether it be increasing, decreasing or eliminating) other pre-existing fees, reconfiguration of our aircraft cabins, and efforts to optimize our network including by focusing growth on a limited number of large hubs and entering into agreements with other airlines. For example, in 2020, we eliminated change fees for most domestic and international tickets, which has reduced our change fee revenue, a trend which is expected to continue assuming this policy remains in place. We may introduce additional 34Table of Contentsinitiatives in the future; however, as time goes on, we expect that it will be more difficult to identify and implement additional initiatives. We cannot assure that these measures or any future initiatives will be successful in increasing our revenues or offsetting our costs. Additionally, the implementation of these initiatives may create logistical challenges that could harm the operational performance of our airline or result in decreased demand. Also, our implementation of any new or increased fees might result in adverse brand perceptions, reputational harm or regulatory scrutiny, and could reduce the demand for air travel on our airline or across the industry in general, particularly if weakened economic conditions make our customers more sensitive to increased travel costs or provide a significant competitive advantage to other carriers that determine not to institute similar charges.Our intellectual property rights, particularly our branding rights, are valuable, and any inability to protect them may adversely affect our business and financial results. We consider our intellectual property rights, particularly our branding rights such as our trademarks applicable to our airline and AAdvantage loyalty program, to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business. We protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademark, copyright and other forms of legal protection, contractual agreements and policing of third-party misuses of our intellectual property. Our failure to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property or any change in law that lessens or removes the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and adversely affect our business and financial results. Any litigation or disputes regarding intellectual property may be costly and time-consuming and may divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations, either of which may adversely affect our business and financial results.In addition, we have used certain of our branding and AAdvantage loyalty program intellectual property as collateral for various financings (including the AAdvantage Financing), which contain covenants that impose restrictions on the use of such intellectual property and, in the case of the AAdvantage Financing, on certain amendments or changes to our AAdvantage loyalty program. These covenants may have an adverse effect on our ability to use such intellectual property.We may be a party to litigation in the normal course of business or otherwise, which could affect our financial position and liquidity.From time to time, we are a party to or otherwise involved in legal proceedings, claims and government inspections or investigations and other legal matters, both inside and outside the United States, arising in the ordinary course of our business or otherwise. We are currently involved in various legal proceedings and claims that have not yet been fully resolved, and additional claims may arise in the future. Legal proceedings can be complex and take many months, or even years, to reach resolution, with the final outcome depending on a number of variables, some of which are not within our control. Litigation is subject to significant uncertainty and may be expensive, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations. Although we will vigorously defend ourselves in such legal proceedings, their ultimate resolution and potential financial and other impacts on us are uncertain. For these and other reasons, we may choose to settle legal proceedings and claims, regardless of their actual merit. If a legal proceeding is resolved against us, it could result in significant compensatory damages, and in certain circumstances punitive or trebled damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief imposed on us. If our existing insurance does not cover the amount or types of damages awarded, or if other resolution or actions taken as a result of the legal proceeding were to restrain our ability to operate or market our services, our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, legal proceedings, and any adverse resolution thereof, can result in adverse publicity and damage to our reputation, which could adversely impact our business. Additional information regarding certain legal matters in which we are involved can be found in Note 11(e) to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 10(e) to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B.Our ability to utilize our NOLs and other carryforwards may be limited.Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), a corporation is generally allowed a deduction for net operating losses (NOLs) carried over from prior taxable years. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $16.2 billion of gross federal NOLs and $4.3 billion of other carryforwards available to reduce future federal taxable income, of which $5.9 billion will expire beginning in 2024 if unused and $14.6 billion can be carried forward indefinitely. We also had approximately $6.0 billion of NOL carryforwards to reduce future state taxable income at December 31, 2022, which will expire in taxable years 2022 through 2042 if unused. Our NOL carryforwards are subject to adjustment on audit by the Internal Revenue Service and the respective state taxing authorities. Additionally, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other economic factors, certain of the NOL carryforwards may expire before we can generate sufficient taxable income to use them.35Table of ContentsOur ability to use our NOLs and other carryforwards depends on the amount of taxable income generated in future periods. There can be no assurance that an additional valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets will not be required should our financial performance be negatively impacted in the future. Such valuation allowance could be material.A corporation’s ability to deduct its federal NOL carryforwards and to utilize certain other available tax attributes can be substantially constrained under the general annual limitation rules of Section 382 of the Code (Section 382) if it undergoes an “ownership change” as defined in Section 382 (generally where cumulative stock ownership changes among material stockholders exceed 50% during a rolling three-year period). In 2013, we experienced an ownership change in connection with our emergence from bankruptcy and US Airways Group, Inc. (US Airways Group) experienced an ownership change in connection with the merger of US Airways Group and AMR Corporation (the Merger). The general limitation rules for a debtor in a bankruptcy case are liberalized where the ownership change occurs upon emergence from bankruptcy. We elected to be covered by certain special rules for federal income tax purposes that permitted approximately $9.0 billion (with $4.4 billion of unlimited NOLs still remaining at December 31, 2022) of our federal NOL carryforwards to be utilized without regard to the annual limitation generally imposed by Section 382. If the special rules are determined not to apply, our ability to utilize such federal NOL carryforwards may be subject to limitation. In addition, under the loan program of the CARES Act, the warrants (and common stock issuable upon exercise thereof) we issued to Treasury did not and will not result in an “ownership change” for purposes of Section 382. This exception does not apply for companies issuing warrants, stock options, common or preferred stock or other equity pursuant to PSP1, PSP2 and PSP3 and accordingly will not apply to the warrants issued by us under PSP1, PSP2 and PSP3. Substantially all of our remaining federal NOL carryforwards attributable to US Airways Group and its subsidiaries are subject to limitation under Section 382 as a result of the Merger; however, our ability to utilize such NOL carryforwards is not anticipated to be effectively constrained as a result of such limitation. Similar limitations may apply for state income tax purposes.Notwithstanding the foregoing, an ownership change may severely limit or effectively eliminate our ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards and other tax attributes. In connection with the expiration in December 2021 of certain transfer restrictions applicable to substantial shareholders contained in our Certificate of Incorporation, the Board of Directors of AAG adopted a tax benefits preservation plan (the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan) in order to preserve our ability to use our NOLs and certain other tax attributes to reduce potential future income tax obligations. The Tax Benefits Preservation Plan was subsequently ratified by our stockholders at the 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of AAG. The Tax Benefits Preservation Plan is designed to reduce the likelihood that we experience an ownership change by deterring certain acquisitions of AAG common stock. There is no assurance, however, that the deterrent mechanism will be effective, and such acquisitions may still occur. In addition, the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan may adversely affect the marketability of AAG common stock by discouraging existing or potential investors from acquiring AAG common stock or additional shares of AAG common stock, because any non-exempt third party that acquires 4.9% or more of the then-outstanding shares of AAG common stock would suffer substantial dilution of its ownership interest in AAG. New U.S. tax legislation may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (the IRA) was signed into law in the U.S. Among other changes, the IRA introduced a corporate minimum tax on certain corporations with average adjusted financial statement income over a three-tax year period in excess of $1.0 billion and an excise tax on certain stock repurchases by certain covered corporations for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022. The corporate minimum tax and any excise tax imposed on any repurchases of AAG common stock made after December 31, 2022 may adversely affect our financial condition in the future. The U.S. government may enact additional significant changes to the taxation of business entities including, among others, an increase in the corporate income tax rate, significant changes to the taxation of income derived from international operations, and an addition of further limitations on the deductibility of business interest. We are currently unable to predict whether such additional changes will occur. If such changes are enacted or implemented, we are currently unable to predict the ultimate impact on our business and therefore there can be no assurance our business will not be adversely affected.36Table of ContentsWe have a significant amount of goodwill, which is assessed for impairment at least annually. In addition, we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets or long-lived assets, causing us to record material impairment charges.Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are assessed for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred.

We caution the reader that these risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risks and uncertainties, nor can it assess the extent to which any of the risk factors below or any such new risks and uncertainties, or any combination thereof, may impact our business. These risks are more fully described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. These risks include, among others, the following:Risks Related to our Business and Industry •Downturns in economic conditions could adversely affect our business. •We will need to obtain sufficient financing or other capital to operate successfully.•Our high level of debt and other obligations may limit our ability to fund general corporate requirements and obtain additional financing, may limit our flexibility in responding to competitive developments and may cause our business to be vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions.•We have significant pension and other postretirement benefit funding obligations, which may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.•If our financial condition worsens, provisions in our credit card processing and other commercial agreements may adversely affect our liquidity.•The loss of key personnel upon whom we depend to operate our business or the inability to attract and develop additional qualified personnel could adversely affect our business.•Our business has been and will continue to be affected by many changing economic and other conditions beyond our control, including global events that affect travel behavior, and our results of operations could be volatile and fluctuate due to seasonality. •Union disputes, employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions, or our inability to otherwise maintain labor costs at competitive levels and hire and retain a sufficient number of employees may adversely affect our operations and financial performance.•If we encounter problems with any of our third-party regional operators or third-party service providers, our operations could be adversely affected by a resulting decline in revenue or negative public perception about our services.•Any damage to our reputation or brand image could adversely affect our business or financial results.•Changes to our business model that are designed to increase revenues may not be successful and may cause operational difficulties or decreased demand.•Our intellectual property rights, particularly our branding rights, are valuable, and any inability to protect them may adversely affect our business and financial results.•We may be a party to litigation in the normal course of business or otherwise, which could affect our financial position and liquidity.•Our ability to utilize our NOLs and other carryforwards may be limited.5Table of Contents•We have a significant amount of goodwill, which is assessed for impairment at least annually. In addition, we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets or long-lived assets, causing us to record material impairment charges.•The airline industry is intensely competitive and dynamic.•The commercial relationships that we have with other companies, including any related equity investments, may not produce the returns or results we expect.•Our business is very dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Continued periods of high volatility in fuel costs, increased fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a significant negative impact on consumer demand, our operating results and liquidity.•Our business is subject to extensive government regulation, which may result in increases in our costs, disruptions to our operations, limits on our operating flexibility, reductions in the demand for air travel, and competitive disadvantages.•We operate a global business with international operations that are subject to economic and political instability and have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by numerous events, circumstances or government actions beyond our control.•We may be adversely affected by conflicts overseas or terrorist attacks; the travel industry continues to face ongoing security concerns.•We are subject to risks associated with climate change, including increased regulation of our CO2 emissions, changing consumer preferences and the potential increased impacts of severe weather events on our operations and infrastructure.•A shortage of pilots or other personnel has in the past and could continue to materially adversely affect our business.•We depend on a limited number of suppliers for aircraft, aircraft engines and parts.•Delays in scheduled aircraft deliveries or other loss of anticipated fleet capacity, and failure of new aircraft to perform as expected, may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.•We rely heavily on technology and automated systems to operate our business, and any failure of these technologies or systems could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.•Evolving data security and privacy requirements (in particular, compliance with applicable federal, state and foreign laws relating to handling of personal information about individuals) could increase our costs, and any significant data security or privacy incident could disrupt our operations, harm our reputation, expose us to legal risks and otherwise materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.•We rely on third-party distribution channels and must manage effectively the costs, rights and functionality of these channels.•If we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate facilities and infrastructure throughout our system and, at some airports, adequate slots, we may be unable to operate our existing flight schedule and to expand or change our route network in the future, which may have a material adverse impact on our operations.6Table of Contents Item 7.

Also, see Note 1(m) to each of AAG’s and American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Items 8A and 8B, respectively, for passenger revenue by geographic region and Note 13 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 12 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for information regarding operating segments. RegionalOur regional carriers provide scheduled air transportation under the brand name “American Eagle.” The American Eagle carriers include our wholly-owned regional carriers Envoy Air Inc. (Envoy), PSA and Piedmont, as well as third-party regional carriers including Republic Airways Inc. (Republic), SkyWest Airlines, Inc. (SkyWest), Mesa Airlines, Inc. (Mesa) and Air Wisconsin Airlines LLC (Air Wisconsin). Our regional carriers are an integral component of our operating network. We rely heavily on regional carriers to drive feeder traffic to our hubs from low-density markets that are not economical for us to serve with larger, mainline aircraft. In addition, regional carriers offer complementary service in many of our mainline markets. All American Eagle carriers use logos, service marks, aircraft paint schemes and uniforms similar to those of our mainline operations. In 2022, 48 million passengers boarded our regional flights, approximately 44% of whom connected to or from our mainline flights.Our regional carrier arrangements are in the form of capacity purchase agreements. The capacity purchase agreements provide that all revenues, including passenger, in-flight, ancillary, mail and freight revenues, go to us. We control marketing, scheduling, ticketing, pricing and seat inventories. In return, we agree to pay predetermined fees to these airlines for operating an agreed-upon number of aircraft, without regard to the number of passengers on board. In addition, these agreements provide that we either reimburse or pay 100% of certain variable costs, such as airport landing fees, fuel and passenger liability insurance. We previously announced that we had entered into an agreement with Air Wisconsin, pursuant to which Air Wisconsin is expected to begin operating scheduled flights under the American Eagle name in the first quarter of 2023. Additionally, in December 2022, we announced a wind-down of our relationship with Mesa, which we expect to conclude in the second quarter of 2023.7Table of ContentsCargoOur cargo division provides a wide range of freight and mail services, with facilities and interline connections available across the globe. In 2022, we served more than 20,000 unique origin and destination pairs, transporting over 890 million pounds of time-sensitive freight and mail across our network. Also in 2022, we were named Best Cargo Airline from the Americas by Air Cargo News.Distribution and Marketing AgreementsPassengers can purchase tickets for travel on American through several distribution channels, including our website (www.aa.com), our mobile app, our reservations centers and third-party distribution channels, including those provided by or through global distribution systems (e.g., Amadeus, Sabre and Travelport), conventional travel agents, travel management companies and online travel agents (e.g., Expedia, including its booking sites Orbitz and Travelocity, and Booking Holdings, including its booking sites Kayak and Priceline). In 2022, American entered into new long-term distribution agreements with Amadeus, Sabre and Travelport which will allow us to continue to provide convenient ways for customers to purchase travel from American. To remain competitive, we will need to manage our distribution costs and rights effectively, increase our distribution flexibility and improve the functionality of our proprietary and third-party distribution channels, while maintaining an industry-competitive cost structure. For more discussion, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – “We rely on third-party distribution channels and must manage effectively the costs, rights and functionality of these channels.”In general, beyond nonstop city pairs, carriers that have the greatest ability to seamlessly connect passengers to and from markets have a competitive advantage. In some cases, however, foreign governments limit U.S. air carriers’ rights to transport passengers beyond designated gateway cities in foreign countries. In order to improve access to domestic and foreign markets, we have arrangements with other airlines including through the oneworld Alliance, other cooperation agreements, joint business agreements and marketing relationships, as further discussed below.Member of oneworld AllianceAmerican is a founding member of the oneworld Alliance, which currently includes Alaska Airlines, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Finnair, Iberia, Japan Airlines, Malaysia Airlines, Qantas Airways (Qantas), Qatar Airways, Royal Air Maroc, Royal Jordanian Airlines and SriLankan Airlines. Fiji Airways is a oneworld connect partner and Oman Air is expected to join the oneworld Alliance in 2024. The oneworld Alliance links the networks of member carriers and their respective affiliates to enhance customer service and provide smooth connections to the destinations served by the alliance, including linking member carriers’ loyalty programs and providing reciprocal access to the carriers’ airport lounge facilities.Cooperation and Joint Business AgreementsAmerican has established a transatlantic joint business with British Airways, Aer Lingus, Iberia and Finnair, a transpacific joint business with Japan Airlines and a joint business relating to Australia and New Zealand with Qantas. Joint business agreements enable the carriers involved to cooperate on flights between particular destinations and allow pooling and sharing of certain revenues and costs, enhanced loyalty program reciprocity and cooperation in other areas. Joint business agreements have become a common approach among major carriers to address key regulatory restrictions typically applicable to international airline service, including limitations on the foreign ownership of airlines and national laws prohibiting foreign airlines from carrying passengers beyond specific gateway cities. American and its joint business partners received regulatory approval to enter into each of these cooperation agreements and each has been granted antitrust immunity. Our competitors, including Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, are party to similar arrangements.The business relationship under the transatlantic joint business benefits from a grant of antitrust immunity from the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and was reviewed by the European Commission (EC) in July 2010. In connection with this review, we provided certain commitments to the EC regarding, among other things, the availability of take-off and landing slots at London Heathrow (LHR) or London Gatwick (LGW) airports. The commitments accepted by the EC were binding for 10 years. In October 2018, in anticipation of the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union (EU), commonly referred to as Brexit, and the expiry of the EC commitments in July 2020, the United Kingdom Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) opened an investigation into the transatlantic joint business. We continue to fully cooperate with the CMA and, in September 2020 and April 2022, the CMA adopted interim measures that effectively extend the EC commitments until March 2026 in light of the uncertainty and other impacts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The CMA plans to complete its investigation before the scheduled expiration of the interim measures in March 2026.8Table of ContentsMarketing RelationshipsTo improve access to each other’s markets, various U.S. and foreign air carriers, including American, have established marketing agreements with other airlines. These marketing agreements are intended to provide enhanced customer choice by means of an expanded network with reciprocal loyalty program participation and joint sales cooperation. As of December 31, 2022, American had codeshare, marketing and/or loyalty program relationships with Aer Lingus, Air Tahiti Nui, Alaska Airlines, British Airways, Cape Air, Cathay Pacific, China Southern Airlines Company Limited (China Southern Airlines), EL AL Israel Airlines, Etihad Airways, Fiji Airways, Finnair, GOL Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes S.A. (GOL), Gulf Air, Hawaiian Airlines, Iberia, IndiGo, Japan Airlines, JetBlue Airways Corporation (JetBlue), Jetstar, Jetstar Japan, Malaysia Airlines, Qantas, Qatar Airways, Royal Air Maroc, Royal Jordanian Airlines, Silver Airways, SriLankan Airlines and Vueling Airlines.In 2022, we entered into an investment agreement with GOL, a Brazilian low-cost airline. This expanded partnership with GOL includes an exclusive codeshare agreement allowing customers access to more than 30 destinations served by American in the U.S. and more than 30 destinations served by GOL in South America. Members of GOL’s SMILES and American’s AAdvantage loyalty programs will also benefit from a deeper loyalty program partnership. In addition, the expanded partnership with GOL will allow further commercial cooperation in areas such as purchasing, sales tools and systems integration, subject to relevant regulatory and contractual limitations.Also in 2022, we expanded our strategic alliance with Qatar Airways, enabling American’s customers to book travel on Qatar Airways flights between the U.S. and Doha, Qatar and connecting to and from select destinations throughout the Middle East, East Africa, South Asia and Southeast Asia gateways. In addition to this expanded codeshare, we launched new service in 2022 from New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) to Doha’s Hamad International Airport.Additionally, in December 2022, we completed an investment agreement with JetSmart Airlines SpA (JetSMART), an ultra-low-cost carrier operating in South America, which includes a codeshare agreement that remains to be implemented.In 2021, we began implementing key aspects of our marketing relationship with JetBlue, creating seamless connectivity for travelers in the U.S. Northeast and more choice for customers across our complementary domestic and international networks. This arrangement includes an alliance agreement with reciprocal codesharing on certain domestic and international routes from New York (JFK, LaGuardia Airport (LGA) and Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR)) and Boston Logan International Airport (BOS), and provides for reciprocal loyalty program benefits. The arrangement does not include JetBlue’s transatlantic flying. Pursuant to federal law, American and JetBlue submitted this proposed alliance arrangement to the DOT for review. After American, JetBlue and the DOT agreed to a series of commitments, the DOT terminated its review of the proposed alliance in January 2021. The commitments include growth commitments to ensure capacity expansion, slot divestitures at JFK and at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) near Washington, D.C. and antitrust compliance measures. Beyond this agreement with the DOT (the DOT Agreement), American and JetBlue will also refrain from certain kinds of coordination on certain city pair markets. Upon the DOT’s termination of its review of the proposed alliance, American and JetBlue implemented the proposed alliance subject to these commitments. On September 21, 2021, the United States Department of Justice (the DOJ), joined by Attorneys General from six states and the District of Columbia, filed an antitrust complaint against American and JetBlue in the District of Massachusetts alleging that American and JetBlue violated U.S. antitrust law in connection with the Northeast Alliance arrangement (the NEA). The parties presented their respective cases in a bench trial that commenced on September 27, 2022. Closing arguments from both parties were presented on November 18, 2022. A decision is expected in the first quarter of 2023. Separately, in December 2022, two putative class action lawsuits were filed in the Eastern District of New York also alleging that the NEA violated the antitrust law. Those lawsuits, which have been consolidated, seek monetary and injunctive relief. In February 2023, private party plaintiffs filed two additional putative class action antitrust complaints against American and JetBlue in the District of Massachusetts and the Eastern District of New York, respectively. We believe these complaints are without merit and are defending against them vigorously.We also have a marketing relationship with Alaska Airlines which includes an expanded codeshare agreement (including codeshare on certain of our international routes from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and Los Angeles International Airport (LAX)), reciprocal loyalty program benefits and shared lounge access. Prior to its implementation, American and Alaska Airlines submitted this arrangement to the DOT for review pursuant to federal law. After the DOT allowed the review period to expire with no further actions, American and Alaska Airlines commenced implementation of this arrangement.9Table of ContentsLoyalty ProgramOur loyalty program, AAdvantage®, was established to develop passenger loyalty by offering benefits and awards to travelers for their continued patronage with American and our partners. AAdvantage members earn mileage credits for flying on American, any oneworld Alliance airline or other partner airlines. For every dollar spent by flying on American, members earn mileage credits, and Gold, Platinum, Platinum Pro and Executive Platinum status holders earn additional bonus mileage credits of 40%, 60%, 80% and 120%, respectively. Members also earn mileage credits by using the services of more than 1,000 non-flight partners, such as our co-branded credit cards, and certain hotel and car rental companies. The AAdvantage program in general, and our co-branded credit cards in particular, are significant assets of our business and have become increasingly important to our company over time.Mileage credits can be redeemed for free or upgraded travel on American and participating airlines, membership to our Admirals Club® or for other non-flight awards, such as car rentals and hotels, from our program partners. Travel awards are available on all flights operated by American and at times are subject to capacity-controlled seating on flights operated by our partners. A member’s mileage credits generally do not expire if that member has any type of qualifying activity at least once every 24 months or if the AAdvantage member is the primary holder of a co-branded credit card. Starting in 2022, AAdvantage members have more pathways to status and only one metric to track: Loyalty Points, which can be earned through a variety of qualifying travel and non-travel activities, including use of our co-branded credit cards. Loyalty Points are used for measuring status qualification in the AAdvantage program over a 12-month period beginning on March 1 of each year. Status members can enjoy additional travel benefits of the AAdvantage program, including complimentary upgrades, checked bags, and Preferred and Main Cabin Extra seats, as well as priority check-in, security, boarding and baggage delivery when traveling on American, any oneworld Alliance airline or other partner airlines. In addition, we introduced Loyalty Point Rewards, which, starting in March 2023, will allow members to unlock benefits, rewards and choices before, between and beyond the traditional status tiers.In 2022, AAdvantage was recognized as the Best Elite Program in the Americas by the 2022 Freddie Awards, which is based entirely on votes from travelers around the world. In addition, the editorial staff of the digital news outlet, The Points Guy, selected AAdvantage Executive Platinum Status as the Best U.S. Airline Elite Status and awarded Loyalty Points with the Innovation Award for Loyalty.Under our agreements with AAdvantage members and program partners, we reserve the right to change the terms of the AAdvantage program at any time and without notice, and may end the program with six months’ notice. Program rules, partners, special offers, awards and requisite mileage levels for awards are subject to change.During 2022, our members redeemed approximately 13 million awards, including travel redemptions for flights and upgrades on American and other air carriers, as well as redemption of car and hotel awards, club memberships and merchandise. Approximately 7% of our 2022 total revenue passenger miles flown were from award travel.See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” for more information on our loyalty program.Industry CompetitionDomesticThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive. On most of our domestic nonstop routes, we face competing service from other domestic airlines, including major network airlines, low-cost carriers and ultra-low-cost carriers such as Alaska Airlines, Allegiant Air, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, JetBlue, Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines and United Airlines. Between cities that require a connection, where the major airlines compete via their respective hubs, competition is significant. In addition, we face competition on some of our connecting routes from airlines operating point-to-point service on such routes. We also compete with all-cargo and charter airlines and, particularly on shorter segments, ground and rail transportation.On all of our routes, pricing decisions are affected, in large part, by the need to meet competition from other airlines. Price competition occurs on a market-by-market basis through price discounts, changes in pricing structures, fare matching, targeted promotions and loyalty program initiatives. Airlines typically use discounted fares and other promotions to stimulate traffic during normally weak travel periods, when they begin service to new cities, when they have excess capacity, to generate cash flow, to maximize revenue per available seat mile or to establish, increase or preserve market share. Most airlines will quickly match price reductions in a particular market, and we have often elected to match discounted or promotional fares initiated by other air carriers in certain markets in order to compete in those markets. In addition, we face pricing pressures from so-called ultra-low-cost carriers, such as Allegiant Air, Frontier Airlines and Spirit 10Table of ContentsAirlines, which compete in many of the markets in which we operate, with competition from these carriers increasing and new entrants regularly announcing their intention to start up new ultra-low-cost carriers.In addition to price competition, airlines compete for market share by increasing the size of their route system and the number of markets they serve. The American Eagle regional carriers increase the number of markets we serve by flying to smaller markets and providing connections at our hubs. Many of our competitors also own or have agreements with regional airlines that provide similar services at their hubs and other locations. We also compete on the basis of scheduling (frequency and flight times), availability of nonstop flights, on-time performance, type of equipment, cabin configuration, amenities provided to passengers, loyalty programs, the automation of travel agent reservation systems, onboard products, health and safety, sustainability initiatives and other services. InternationalIn addition to our extensive domestic service, we provide international service to Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, Central and South America, Europe, China, Japan, Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand. In 2022, we launched service to Doha, Qatar, allowing customers to connect to and from select destinations throughout the Middle East, East Africa, South Asia and Southeast Asia gateways. In providing international air transportation, we compete with other U.S. airlines, foreign investor-owned airlines and foreign state-owned or state-affiliated airlines. Competition has also been increasing from low-cost airlines executing international long-haul expansion strategies, a trend we also expect to continue, in particular with the planned introduction of long-range narrowbody aircraft in the coming years.In order to increase our ability to compete in the market for international air transportation service, which is subject to extensive government regulation, U.S. and foreign carriers have entered into bilateral and multilateral marketing relationships, alliances, cooperation agreements and joint business agreements to exchange traffic among each other’s flights and route networks. See “Distribution and Marketing Agreements” above for further discussion.SustainabilityOur purpose is to care for people on life’s journey. Conducting our business with a view towards operating a sustainable business that has the ability to serve our stakeholders over the long-term is an important part of this purpose. We have increased our focus over time on a number of elements that we view as important to build a more sustainable company, including those described below.ClimateWe recognize the challenge of climate change and have set ambitious goals to transition to operating a low-carbon airline over time.Our aim is to achieve net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050, and we have set an intermediate target to drive progress toward that goal. In April 2022, we received validation from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) that our 2035 GHG reduction target complies with the SBTi criteria.The vast majority of our direct GHG emissions comes from the use of jet fuel in our operations. Our current strategy for reaching net zero emissions by 2050 is focused on running a more fuel-efficient operation, with more fuel-efficient aircraft, powered by low-carbon fuel. To do so, we are working to drive progress across several key levers, including:•Continuing to replace older, less fuel-efficient aircraft with new, more efficient aircraft over time;•Helping scale the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) with the aim of transitioning to lower-carbon fuels. Currently, SAF is not available at the cost or scale necessary to meet our industry’s needs. We continue to enter into agreements to purchase SAF as part of our goal to replace 10% of our conventional jet fuel with SAF in 2030 and to encourage investment in SAF; and•Evaluating and investing in innovations that may enable commercial aircraft to be powered by low- and no-carbon fuel sources over the long term. For example, in 2022 we made direct investments in ZeroAvia and Universal Hydrogen, companies working to develop hydrogen-electric propulsion technology and green hydrogen distribution, respectively. We are also an anchor partner of Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, which aims to make investments to accelerate the development of new clean energy technologies.11Table of ContentsAchieving our ambitious goals will require significant action and investments by governments, manufacturers and other stakeholders. We are committed to engaging with our stakeholders to seek to advance these initiatives, and we have dedicated resources to advance our own progress. Our Board and Corporate Governance, Public Responsibility and Safety Committee receive updates on our climate strategy, progress and key risks regularly. And, in 2022, we formally assigned responsibility for oversight of our climate change strategy at the management level to our Chief Executive Officer.SafetyThe safety of our customers and team members is a top priority. Our approach to safety is guided by our Safety Management System (SMS), an organization-wide approach to identifying and managing risk. The SMS is comprised of four components: Safety Policy, Safety Assurance, Safety Risk Management and Safety Promotion. Our Safety Policy sets safety objectives while striving to comply with applicable regulatory requirements and laws in the countries where we operate and establishing standards for acceptable operational behaviors.The Safety Assurance component of our SMS specifies how we use data and conduct quality assurance and internal oversight to validate the effectiveness of risk controls and the performance of the SMS. The Safety Risk Management (SRM) element of our SMS provides a decision-making process for identifying hazards and mitigating risk based on a thorough understanding of our systems and their operating environment. We employ SRM whenever there is a significant change to our operations, such as delivery of new aircraft. Lastly, the Safety Promotion component includes training and raising awareness among team members so that they can spot potential safety events.CustomersWe fly to more than 300 destinations in the United States and internationally, and we are committed to providing our customers with a world-class travel experience. We continued to rigorously measure and track customer satisfaction through passenger surveys in 2022, efforts that led to further improvements in our operations and the services we provide.In 2022:•We recorded a record Likelihood to Recommend score based on our internal customer data derived from approximately three million surveys completed by our customers in 2022; and •We were recognized for the fifth consecutive year with the prestigious Five Star rating in The APEX Official Airline Ratings – Global Airline category. This rating is based on verified customer feedback on the overall travel experience.Our PeopleThe airline business is labor intensive, and our team members are critical to delivering for our customers. The operational complexity of our business requires a diverse team of personnel trained and experienced in a variety of technical areas such as flight operations, ground operations, safety and maintenance, customer service and airline scheduling and planning. We believe that if we create an environment where our team members feel supported, they will take care of our customers and thereby support the success of our business. To do this, we must continue to build a diverse and inclusive environment, helping all team members reach their full potential and providing them with the right resources and support.Talent DevelopmentWe focus on providing our team members the tools, training and resources they need to do their best work. We maintain a suite of programs aimed at helping our people develop the skills and experience they need to succeed in their roles and build rewarding, long-term careers within our company. Additionally, we have partnered with leading online learning platforms to make professional development available on-demand to all of our team members.Diversity, Equity and InclusionCultivating an environment that celebrates diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) is a priority for us, and we seek to create a workplace where diverse perspectives and experiences are welcomed and encouraged, where team members feel comfortable to be their authentic selves and where we are always learning from one another. Our goal is to make culture a competitive advantage so people will want to work with us, fly with us and invest in us. We are implementing a multiyear strategy focused on embedding DEI throughout our company by:12Table of Contents•Hiring, engaging and retaining talent for growth;•Delivering excellence in our operations to serve and expand our global markets;•Striving to have our teams reflect the diversity of our global customer base; and•Driving innovation to build competitive advantages.In 2022, we received a perfect score on the 2022 Disability Equality Index and were designated a Human Rights Campaign’s 2022 Best Place to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality. We also launched the Selection, Onboarding, Advancement and Retention program, an expansion of our Executive Sponsorship Program, which creates a sustainable foundation for supporting diverse talent and underrepresented groups across our company.Competitive Pay and Comprehensive BenefitsWe seek to offer competitive pay, comprehensive benefits and a wide variety of resources designed to support the physical, behavioral and financial well-being of our team members and their families, including medical coverage that is intended to be affordable and flexible along with healthcare navigation and support tools.Our internal recognition programs give team members and customers the opportunity to show their appreciation for a job well done, including through our Nonstop Thanks program whereby team members can award each other points for exceptional service or as an expression of gratitude. Recognition points earned through the recognition program can be redeemed for items in an online catalog. In 2022, our team members were recognized by customers, peers and company leaders over two million times and hundreds of team members were nominated for the annual Chairman’s Award, the highest honor that we bestow upon our team members.Our future success depends in large part on our ability to attract, develop and retain highly qualified management, technical and other personnel. Retaining and recruiting people with the appropriate skills has been particularly challenging as the economy in general, and the airline industry in particular, have continued to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. A rapid return of demand for air travel and the corresponding need for airlines to staff expanding operations resulted in a period of intense competition for the human resources necessary to operate our business successfully. Like many other airlines, we have experienced and continue to experience periodic shortages of frontline team members as a result. Certain of these personnel shortages, such as pilots, are systemic and could persist for some time. For more discussion, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – “The loss of key personnel upon whom we depend to operate our business or the inability to attract and develop additional qualified personnel could adversely affect our business.”Labor RelationsIn 2022, mainline and regional salaries, wages and benefits were our largest expense and represented 32% of our total operating expenses. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 129,700 active full-time equivalent employees, approximately 87% of whom were represented by various labor unions responsible for negotiating the collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) governing their compensation and job duties, among other things. Labor relations in the air transportation industry are regulated under the Railway Labor Act (RLA), which vests in the National Mediation Board (NMB) certain functions with respect to disputes between airlines and labor unions relating to union representation and CBAs.13Table of ContentsThe following table shows our domestic airline employee groups that are represented by unions:UnionClass or CraftEmployees (1)ContractAmendable DateMainline: Allied Pilots Association (APA)Pilots13,450 2020Association of Professional Flight Attendants (APFA)Flight Attendants23,200 2019Airline Customer Service Employee Association – Communications Workers of America and International Brotherhood of Teamsters (CWA-IBT) Passenger Service14,650 2020Transport Workers Union and International Association of Machinists & Aerospace Workers (TWU-IAM Association) Mechanics and Related11,850 2025TWU-IAM AssociationFleet Service18,700 2025TWU-IAM AssociationStock Clerks1,950 2025TWU-IAM AssociationFlight Simulator Engineers140 2025TWU-IAM AssociationMaintenance Control Technicians180 2025TWU-IAM AssociationMaintenance Training Instructors100 2025Professional Airline Flight Control Association (PAFCA)Dispatchers560 2025Transport Workers Union (TWU)Flight Crew Training Instructors390 2025Envoy: Air Line Pilots Associations (ALPA)Pilots1,850 2029Association of Flight Attendants-CWA (AFA)Flight Attendants1,800 2026TWUGround School Instructors10 2027TWUMechanics and Related1,150 2021TWUStock Clerks120 2021TWUSimulator Instructors20 2026TWUFleet Service3,950 2026TWUDispatchers70 2025Communications Workers of America (CWA)Passenger Service6,500 2026Piedmont: ALPAPilots740 2029AFAFlight Attendants310 2026International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT)Mechanics and Related400 2026IBTStock Clerks60 2026CWAFleet and Passenger Service6,300 2023IBTDispatchers30 2025ALPAFlight Crew Training Instructors70 2029PSA: ALPAPilots1,550 2028AFAFlight Attendants1,200 2023International Association of Machinists & Aerospace Workers (IAM)Mechanics and Related620 2022TWUDispatchers50 2024ALPAFlight Crew Training Instructors120 2028(1)Represents approximate number of active employees as of December 31, 2022.14Table of ContentsCBAs covering our mainline pilots, flight attendants and passenger service are now amendable and negotiations involving these workgroups continue. Among our wholly-owned regional subsidiaries, the Envoy mechanics and related, Envoy stock clerks and PSA mechanics and related have agreements that are now amendable and are engaged in traditional RLA negotiations.For more discussion, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – “Union disputes, employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions, or our inability to otherwise maintain labor costs at competitive levels and hire and retain a sufficient number of employees may adversely affect our operations and financial performance.”Aircraft FuelOur operations and financial results are materially affected by the availability and price of aircraft fuel, which represents one of the largest single cost items in our business. Based on our 2023 forecasted mainline and regional fuel consumption, we estimate that a one cent per gallon increase in the price of aircraft fuel would increase our 2023 annual fuel expense by approximately $40 million.The following table shows annual aircraft fuel consumption and costs, including taxes, for our mainline and regional operations for 2022 and 2021 (gallons and aircraft fuel expense in millions).YearGallonsAverage Priceper GallonAircraft FuelExpensePercent of TotalOperating Expenses20223,901$3.54$13,79129%20213,324$2.04$6,79222%As of December 31, 2022, we did not have any fuel hedging contracts outstanding to hedge our fuel consumption. Our current policy is not to enter into transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, although we review that policy from time to time based on market conditions and other factors. As such, and assuming we do not enter into any future transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, we will continue to be fully exposed to fluctuations in aircraft fuel prices.Aircraft fuel prices have in the past, and may in the future, experience substantial volatility. We cannot predict the future availability, price volatility or cost of aircraft fuel. For more discussion, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – “Our business is very dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Continued periods of high volatility in fuel costs, increased fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a significant negative impact on consumer demand, our operating results and liquidity.”Seasonality and Other FactorsDue to the greater demand for air travel during the summer months, revenues in the airline industry in the second and third quarters of the year tend to be greater than revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year. General economic conditions, fears of terrorism or war, fare initiatives, fluctuations in fuel prices, labor actions, weather, natural disasters, outbreaks of disease and other factors could impact this seasonal pattern. Therefore, our quarterly results of operations are not necessarily indicative of operating results for the entire year, and historical operating results in a quarterly or annual period are not necessarily indicative of future operating results.Domestic and Global Regulatory LandscapeGeneralAirlines are subject to extensive domestic and international regulatory requirements. Domestically, the DOT and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) exercise significant regulatory authority over air carriers.The DOT, among other things, oversees and regulates domestic and international codeshare agreements, international route authorities, competition and consumer protection matters including accessibility, the display and sharing of ancillary fee information and refund practices. The Antitrust Division of the DOJ, along with the DOT in certain instances, have jurisdiction over airline antitrust matters.15Table of ContentsThe FAA similarly exercises safety oversight and regulates most operational matters of our business, including how we operate and maintain our aircraft. FAA requirements cover, among other things, required technology and necessary onboard equipment; systems, procedures and training necessary to ensure the continuous airworthiness of our fleet of aircraft; safety measures and equipment; crew scheduling limitations and experience requirements; and many other technical aspects of airline operations. Additionally, our pilots and other employees are subject to rigorous certification standards, and our pilots and other crew members must adhere to flight time and rest requirements.The FAA also controls the national airspace system, including operational rules and fees for air traffic control (ATC) services. The efficiency, reliability and capacity of the ATC network has a significant impact on our costs and on the timeliness of our operations.The U.S. Postal Service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related services.Airport Access and OperationsDomestically, any U.S. airline authorized by the DOT is generally free to operate scheduled passenger service between any two points within the U.S. and its territories, with the exception of certain airports that require landing and take-off rights and authorizations (slots) and other facilities, and certain airports that impose geographic limitations on operations or curtail operations based on the time of day. Operations at three major domestic airports we serve (JFK and LGA in New York City, and DCA near Washington, D.C.) and many foreign airports we serve (including LHR) are regulated by governmental entities through allocations of slots or similar regulatory mechanisms that limit the rights of carriers to conduct operations at those airports. Each slot represents the authorization to land at or take off from the particular airport during a specified time period. In addition to slot restrictions, operations at DCA and LGA are also limited based on a so-called “perimeter rule” which generally limits the stage length of the flights that can be operated from those airports to 1,250 and 1,500 miles, respectively. Generally, our ability to retain slots is conditioned on the continued use of such slots, and in the absence of use, the slots are subject to forfeiture. In certain circumstances, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic, regulators may issue slot waivers which temporarily suspend or amend slot usage requirements, and we have used slot waivers at times to reduce flying levels given limited demand for travel. We cannot guarantee that such waivers will be made available to us, or that upon expiration or cancellation of such waivers it will be economical for us to resume prior levels of flying to destinations where we have operated a reduced service. If we are forced to surrender slots, we may be unable to provide our desired level of service to or from certain destinations in the future. For more discussion, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – “If we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate facilities and infrastructure throughout our system and, at some airports, adequate slots, we may be unable to operate our existing flight schedule and to expand or change our route network in the future, which may have a material adverse impact on our operations.”Our ability to provide service can also be impaired at airports, such as Chicago O’Hare International Airport (ORD) and LAX, where the airport gate and other facilities are currently inadequate to accommodate all of the service that we would like to provide, or airports such as Dallas Love Field Airport where we have no access to gates at all.Existing law also permits domestic local airport authorities to implement procedures and impose restrictions designed to abate noise, provided such procedures and restrictions do not unreasonably interfere with interstate or foreign commerce or the national transportation system. In some instances, these restrictions have caused curtailments in service or increases in operating costs.Airline Fares, Taxes and User FeesAirlines are permitted to establish their own domestic fares without governmental regulation. The DOT maintains authority over certain international fares, rates and charges, but only applies this authority on a limited basis. In addition, international fares and rates are sometimes subject to the jurisdiction of the governments of the foreign countries which we serve.Airlines are obligated to collect a federal excise tax, commonly referred to as the “ticket tax,” on domestic and international air transportation, and to collect other taxes and charge other fees, such as foreign taxes, security fees and passenger facility charges. Although these taxes and fees are not our operating expenses, they represent an additional cost to our customers. These taxes and fees are subject to increase from time to time.16Table of ContentsDOT Passenger Protection RulesThe DOT regulates airline interactions with passengers through the ticketing process, at the airport and onboard the aircraft. Among other things, these regulations govern how our fares are displayed online, required customer disclosures, access by disabled passengers, handling of long onboard flight delays and reporting of mishandled bags. In 2023, the DOT is expected to propose or implement a number of new disability regulations that will impact us, including rules for accessible lavatories on single-aisle aircraft, penalties for wheelchair loss or damage and prompt wheelchair assistance. The DOT is also expected to f",49994,mgmt,20230222,2023,10K,real_textdata_2023

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation"" of this Form 10-K, as well as in our consolidated financial statements, related notes, and the other information appearing in this Form 10-K and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC""). We do not intend, and undertake no obligation except as required by law, to update any of our forward-looking statements after the date of this Form 10-K to reflect actual results or future events or circumstances. Given these risks and uncertainties, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.Risk Factor SummaryOur businesses are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Any of the following risk factors may cause our actual results to differ materially from historical or anticipated results. These risks and uncertainties are not all inclusive, but represent the risks that we currently believe are material. There may be additional risks that we do not currently consider to be material or of which we are not currently aware. Any of these risks, as well as the risks described below, could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical or anticipated results and could materially and adversely affect several aspects of our performance.Risks Related to our Businesses, Regulatory Environment and Industry•Our businesses are subject to extensive laws and regulations, including laws and regulations unique to the industries in which our businesses operate, that may subject them to government investigations and significant monetary penalties and compliance-related burdens.•Progressive Leasing serves subprime consumers, and its lease-to-own business model poses inherent risks that may have an adverse impact on our financial performance.•Inflation, rising interest rates, and other adverse macro-economic conditions, including a prolonged recession, may adversely affect consumer confidence and demand for the products and services offered by our Progressive Leasing, Vive and Four businesses.•Our customers' inability to make the payments they owe our Progressive Leasing, Vive and Four businesses due to inflation, rising interest rates and other adverse macro-economic conditions may unfavorably impact our overall financial performance.•Given the deteriorating macro-economic environment, our proprietary algorithms and decisioning tools used in approving Progressive Leasing and Vive customers may no longer be indicative of their ability to perform.•A large percentage of Progressive Leasing’s revenue, which represents approximately 97% of PROG Holdings' consolidated revenue, is concentrated with several key point-of-sale partners (whom we refer to as our ""POS partners).""•Progressive Leasing may be unable to attract additional POS partners and consumers and to retain and grow its existing POS and consumer relationships. •The business models for our Vive and Four businesses differ significantly from Progressive Leasing’s lease-to-own business, which creates specific and unique risks including significantly different regulatory risks, particularly at the federal level.•Interruptions, inventory shortages and other factors affecting the supply chains of our retail partners may have a material and adverse effect on several aspects of our performance.•The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and is expected to continue to have, a material and adverse effect on several aspects of our performance.3•Our capital allocation strategy and financial policies, including our current stock repurchase program, as well as any potential debt repurchase or dividend programs, may not be effective at enhancing shareholder value, or providing other benefits we expect.•Our cost reduction initiatives may not be adequate or may have unintended consequences that could be disruptive to our businesses.•The loss of the services of our key executives or our inability to attract and retain key talent, particularly with respect to our information technology function, may have a material adverse impact on our operations.•Our failure to successfully compete in our highly competitive industry may harm several aspects of our performance.•The effects of Progressive Leasing’s 2020 settlement with the FTC are not certain.•The transactions offered to consumers by Progressive Leasing, Vive and Four may be negatively characterized by government officials, consumer advocacy groups and the media.•Any significant disruption in, or errors in, service on Progressive Leasing’s, Vive’s or Four’s platforms or relating to vendors, including events beyond their control, may prevent Progressive Leasing, Vive or Four from processing transactions (including making accurate lease and loan decisioning). •Our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be sufficient to prevent losses in the event we experience a significant disruption in, or errors in, service on Progressive Leasing’s, Vive’s or Four’s platforms.•Real or perceived software errors, failures, bugs, defects, or outages may adversely affect Progressive Leasing, Vive and/or Four. •The ability of Progressive Leasing, Vive and Four to protect confidential, proprietary, or sensitive information, including the confidential information of their customers, may be adversely affected by cyber-attacks, employee or other internal misconduct, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or similar disruptions. •Consumer identity fraud may adversely affect the performance of our businesses' lease and loan portfolios.•E-commerce lease and loan origination processes may give rise to greater risks than in-store originations and processes.•The geographic concentration of Progressive Leasing’s POS partners may magnify the impact of conditions in a particular region, including economic downturns and other occurrences.•Our results largely depend on prominent presentation, integration, and support of Progressive Leasing and Vive's products and services by POS partners.Risks Related to Our Indebtedness•We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.•The terms of our indebtedness may restrict our current and future business plans and strategies, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions.•The portion of our indebtedness that is variable in nature subjects us to interest rate risk, which may cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.Risks Related to the Spin-Off of The Aaron’s Company, Inc.•In connection with the spin-off of The Aaron’s Company, Inc. in November 2020 (the ""Spin-Off""), The Aaron’s Company agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, and we agreed to indemnify The Aaron’s Company for certain liabilities.•If the Spin-Off does not ultimately qualify as a transaction that is generally tax free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we or our shareholders may be subject to significant tax liabilities.•Potential liabilities in connection with the Spin-Off may arise under fraudulent conveyance and transfer laws and legal capital requirements.4 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSOur businesses are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition, or the trading price of our common stock, some of which are described below. These risk factors may not be all of the risks our businesses face because we operate in a continually changing regulatory and macroeconomic environment, and new risks and uncertainties may emerge from time to time. We cannot predict such new risks and uncertainties, nor can we assess the extent to which any of the risk factors below or any such new risks and uncertainties, or any combination thereof, may impact our businesses.Risk FactorsRisks Related to our Businesses, Regulatory Environment and IndustryOur businesses are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, including certain laws and regulations unique to the industries in which our businesses operate, that may subject them to government investigations and significant monetary penalties, remediation expenses and compliance-related burdens that may result in them changing the manner in which they operate, which may be materially adverse to several aspects of our performance.In April 2020, our Progressive Leasing business entered into a settlement with the FTC (the ""FTC Settlement"") to resolve allegations by the FTC that certain of Progressive Leasing’s advertising and marketing practices violated the FTC Act, even though Progressive Leasing believed it was in compliance with the FTC Act, and thus, did not admit any violations of that act or any other laws. Under the FTC Settlement, Progressive Leasing paid $175 million to the FTC and agreed to enhance certain of its compliance-related activities, including augmenting disclosures to its customers and expanding its POS partner monitoring programs. Federal regulatory authorities are increasingly focused on alternative consumer financial services products, including consumer protection within the subprime financial marketplace in which our Progressive Leasing, Vive and Four businesses operate. For example, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (""CFPB"") is currently reviewing the business practices of a number of companies that offer buy-now-pay-later (""BNPL"") services and has alleged several areas of perceived risk of consumer harm, including inconsistent consumer protections and the risk of borrowers becoming overextended. We believe the CFPB’s review is illustrative of the greater focus federal regulatory authorities are putting on alternative consumer financial services products, including within the industries in which our businesses operate, which may result in increased compliance costs and the possibility of significant monetary penalties, remediation expenses and costly changes to the manner in which we conduct our businesses.Any of these federal agencies may propose and adopt new regulations (or interpret existing regulations) that may result in significant adverse changes in the regulatory landscape for Progressive Leasing, Vive and Four. We expect federal regulatory agencies will continue their increased focus on alternative consumer financial services products, and, as a result, businesses transacting with subprime consumers, for example, may be held to higher standards of monitoring, disclosure and reporting, regardless of whether new laws or regulations governing our industry are adopted. This increased attention may increase Progressive Leasing’s, Vive’s and Four’s compliance costs significantly, result in additional fines or monetary penalties or settlements due to future government investigations, and materially and adversely impact the manner in which they operate, which may be materially adverse to several aspects of our performance.In recent years, state regulatory authorities have been increasingly focused on the subprime financial marketplace, including the lease-to-own industry. For example, in August 2022, a complaint was filed by the Pennsylvania Attorney General against the Company's Progressive Leasing business alleging, among other things, that Progressive Leasing was operating in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in violation of the Pennsylvania Rental Purchase Agreement Act by failing to disclose certain terms and conditions of rent-to-own (""RTO"") transactions on ""hang tags"" physically attached to RTO merchandise. Although the Company believes the Pennsylvania Attorney General's claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself, we may incur substantial costs, including legal fees, fines, penalties, and remediation expenses in the matter. Additionally, in early 2021, a number of lease-to-own companies, including the Company's Progressive Leasing business, received a subpoena from the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (the ""DFPI""). The subpoena received by Progressive Leasing in January 2021 from the DFPI requested the production of documents regarding Progressive Leasing's operations and its compliance with state consumer protection laws, including new legislation that went into effect on January 1, 2021. Although the Company believes Progressive Leasing is in compliance with all applicable consumer financial laws and regulations in California, this inquiry may lead to an enforcement action and/or a consent order and substantial costs, including legal fees, fines, penalties, and remediation expenses. While the Company intends to preserve defenses surrounding the jurisdiction of DFPI in this matter, the Company has fully cooperated and anticipates that it will continue cooperating with the DFPI in responding to its inquiry. We are currently unable to predict the ultimate timing or outcome of either the complaint filed by the Pennsylvania Attorney General or the investigation undertaken by the DFPI. In addition, the FTC Settlement may lead to investigations and enforcement actions by, and/or consent orders with, state Attorneys General or other state regulatory agencies. 14Furthermore, in November 2021, Rent-A-Center, Inc. announced that its Acima division (""Acima""), which is a large virtual lease-to-own business that competes with Progressive Leasing, had received a letter from the Nebraska Attorney General’s office stating that the Attorney General of Nebraska, along with a coalition of thirty-eight state Attorneys General, had initiated a multistate investigation into the business acts and practices of Acima. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have not received a similar communication from the Nebraska Attorney General’s office and are not aware of any intention by any state Attorneys General involved in the Acima matter to broaden their investigation to include Progressive Leasing in their investigation. However, there can be no assurance that Progressive Leasing will not be included in such matter and, if it is, that it would not lead to an enforcement action and/or a consent order, or substantial costs, including legal fees, fines, penalties, and remediation expenses. We cannot predict whether any state Attorneys General or state regulatory agencies will direct other investigations or regulatory investigations towards us or our industry in the future, or what the impact of any such future regulatory investigation may be.In addition, certain aspects of Progressive Leasing’s, Vive’s and Four’s businesses, such as the content of their advertising and other disclosures to customers about transactions, their respective data collection practices, the manner in which they may contact their customers, the decisioning process regarding whether to enter into a transaction with a potential customer, their credit reporting practices, and the manner in which they process and store certain customer, employee and other information are subject to federal and state laws and regulatory oversight. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the ""CCPA""), which became effective on January 1, 2020, gives residents of California expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used, and also provides for civil penalties for violations and private rights of action for data breaches. In addition, the California Privacy Rights Act (""CPRA""), which became effective on January 1, 2023, significantly modifies the CCPA, including by expanding consumers’ rights with respect to certain personal information and creating a new state agency to oversee implementation and enforcement efforts. The CCPA, CPRA, and other applicable state and federal privacy laws now require Progressive Leasing, Vive and Four to design, implement and maintain different types of privacy-related compliance controls and programs simultaneously in multiple states, thereby further increasing the complexity and cost of compliance. In addition, certain states' laws limit the total cost that Progressive Leasing may charge a customer in order for the customer to achieve ownership of the leased merchandise at the end of the lease term. We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial costs to comply with federal, state and local laws and regulations, including rapidly evolving expected consumer protection standards. In addition to compliance costs, we may continue to incur substantial expenses to respond to regulatory and other third-party investigations and enforcement actions, proposed fines and penalties, criminal or civil sanctions, and private litigation, as well as potential ""headline risks"" that may negatively impact our business and may adversely affect our share price. Consumer complaints with respect to our industry have resulted in, and may in the future result in, state, federal and local regulatory and other investigations. In addition, while we are not aware of any whistleblower claims regarding Progressive Leasing’s, Vive’s or Four’s specific business practices, such claims are on the rise generally. We believe these claims will likely continue, in part because of the provisions enacted by the Dodd-Frank Act that provide for cash awards to persons who report alleged wrongdoing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and because competitors may use it as a method to weaken their competitors, and others, like former personnel or other constituencies, may use it as means to extract payment or otherwise retaliate.Additionally, as we execute on our strategic plans, we may continue to expand into complementary businesses that engage in financial, consumer credit transactions or lending services, or lease-to-own or rent-to-rent transactions involving products that we do not currently offer our customers, all of which may be subject to a variety of statutes and regulatory requirements in addition to those regulations currently applicable to our operations, which may impose significant costs, limitations or prohibitions on the manner in which we currently conduct our businesses as well as those we may acquire in the future.Progressive Leasing serves subprime consumers. Its lease-to-own business model poses inherent risks that may have a material and adverse effect on our results, financial condition, and prospects.Progressive Leasing offers lease-to-own solutions to subprime consumers through point-of-sale retail partners via in-store, mobile, and online solutions. While this model allows Progressive Leasing to address an underserved, credit-challenged segment of the population with an innovative lease-to-own solution that integrates seamlessly with the traditional and e-commerce retailers with whom Progressive Leasing partners (whom we refer to as our point of sale or ""POS"" partners), it creates specific and unique risks including, among others:•reliance on POS partners (over whom Progressive Leasing does not exercise full control and oversight) for many important business functions, from advertising through assistance with lease transaction applications, including, for example, explaining the nature of the lease-to-own transaction when asked to do so by a consumer;•the potential that federal, state and local regulators will continue to focus on alternative financial services products, including consumer protection with respect to such products within the subprime financial marketplace, and impact lease-to-own transactions by adopting new regulations (or applying existing laws and regulations that were never 15intended to apply to lease-to-own transactions) that require Progressive Leasing to change its business practices in a materially adverse manner;•indemnification obligations to POS partners for losses stemming from, among other matters, Progressive Leasing’s violation of federal, state or local laws or regulations or failure to take the appropriate steps to protect its POS partners’ and customers’ information from being accessed or stolen by unauthorized third parties through cyber-attacks or ""hacking"" or similar occurrences;•reliance on automatic bank account drafts for lease payments, which may become disfavored as a payment method by regulators and/or providers, or may otherwise become unavailable; and•an increase in the risk of consumer fraud since lease decisions are made through remote technology-based platforms and, because transactions are consummated through the Internet, there is a risk customers may challenge, among other potential claims, the authenticity of their documents and whether their electronic signatures are valid.These risks, which may have a material and adverse effect on several aspects of our performance in the future, are described further below.Inflation, rising interest rates, and other adverse macro-economic conditions, including a prolonged recession, may adversely affect consumer confidence and demand for the products and services offered by our Progressive Leasing, Vive and Four businesses.We derive our revenue from the products and services offered by our Progressive Leasing, Vive and Four businesses. Consumer confidence is affected by inflation, rising interest rates, and other macro-economic conditions, including a prolonged recession. A deterioration in consumer confidence could adversely affect our business in many ways, including reducing demand for our products and services. As a result, a sustained decline in macro-economic conditions could result in lower revenue and negatively impact our businesses and the Company's overall financial results. Our customers' inability to make the payments they owe our Progressive Leasing, Vive and Four businesses due to inflation, rising interest rates and other adverse macro-economic conditions, including a prolonged recession, may unfavorably impact our overall financial performance.Inflation has recently increased at the fastest pace in over forty years. In response to these concerns, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates multiple times over the past year, and will likely continue to raise them again in the near term, which could lead to a prolonged economic recession. Food, energy, residential rent and other costs of living have also increased significantly over the last twelve months, which we believe disproportionately negatively affects the customers we serve and therefore may unfavorably impact our customers' ability to make the payments they owe the Company, resulting in increased customer payment delinquencies, lease merchandise write-offs, loan loss provisioning and loan write-offs.Given the deteriorating macro-economic environment, our proprietary algorithms and decisioning tools used in approving Progressive Leasing and Vive customers may no longer be indicative of their ability to perform, which in turn may limit the ability of our Progressive Leasing, Vive and Four businesses to manage risk, avoid lease and loan charge-offs and may result in insufficient reserves to cover actual losses. We believe our proprietary lease and loan decisioning processes to be a key to the success of our Progressive Leasing and Vive businesses. These decisioning processes assume behavior and attributes observed for prior customers, among other factors, are indicative of performance by our future customers. Unexpected changes in customer behavior caused by deteriorating macroeconomic conditions, including, for example, widespread supply chain disruptions and/or the significant increase in inflation in the U.S., which has reached levels not seen since before Progressive Leasing was founded, the U.S. economy experiencing a prolonged recession and/or job losses or increased job absenteeism for hourly employees who are our customers may lead to increased incidences and costs related to lease merchandise write-offs. In addition, we believe that deteriorating macroeconomic conditions such as these lead to general declines in discretionary spending levels and disproportionately negatively impact the customers we serve. As a result, our decisioning process has required, and will likely continue to require, frequent adjustments (including tightening) and the application of greater management judgment in the interpretation of the results produced by our decisioning tools, which could have an unfavorable impact on our GMV, margins and earnings. These decisioning tools may be unable to accurately predict and respond to the impact of a prolonged economic downturn or changes to customer behaviors, which in turn may limit the ability of our Progressive Leasing and Vive businesses to manage risk, avoid lease and loan charge-offs and may result in insufficient reserves to cover actual losses (which Progressive Leasing records as accounts receivable allowance and allowance for lease merchandise write-offs and Vive and Four record as provision for loan losses).16A large percentage of Progressive Leasing’s revenue is concentrated with several key POS partners, and the loss of any of these POS partner relationships would materially and adversely affect several aspects of our performance.Progressive Leasing’s relationship with its largest POS partners will have a significant impact on our operating revenues in future periods. The loss of any key POS partners would have a material adverse effect on our business.For example, during 2022, we derived 49.3% of our consolidated revenues from customers of Progressive Leasing's top three POS partners, and 77.3% of our consolidated revenues from customers of Progressive Leasing's top ten POS partners. Any extended discontinuance of Progressive Leasing’s relationship with any of those POS partners or other high visibility retailers would have a material adverse impact on several aspects of our performance. In addition, in the event that Progressive Leasing enters into new or amended business or contractual terms or conditions with any of its largest POS partners that are less favorable than its current arrangements with those POS partners, including with respect to the prices it pays those POS partners for merchandise that it leases to consumers and/or exclusivity, rebate or other incentive payments it may make to those POS partners, our business and prospects may be materially and adversely effected.Any publicity associated with the loss of any of Progressive Leasing’s large POS partners may harm its reputation, making it more difficult to attract and retain consumers and other POS partners and could lessen its negotiating power with its remaining and prospective POS partners. Our operating revenues and operating results may also suffer if any of Progressive Leasing’s POS partners experiences a significant decline in sales for any reason, including, for example, due to increased inflation and/or a prolonged recession reducing or eliminating many consumers’ discretionary incomes, and/or supply chain interruptions unfavorably impacting the inventories of our POS partners.There can be no assurance that Progressive Leasing will be able to continue its relationships with its largest POS partners on the same or more favorable terms in future periods or that its relationships will continue beyond the terms of its existing contracts with them. Our operating revenues and operating results may suffer if, among other things, any of Progressive Leasing’s POS partners renegotiate, terminate or fail to renew, or fail to renew on similar or favorable terms, their agreements or otherwise choose to modify the level of support they provide for Progressive Leasing’s products and services.If Progressive Leasing is unable to attract additional POS partners and retain and grow its relationships with its existing POS partners, several aspects of our performance would be materially and adversely affected. Our continued success is dependent on the ability of Progressive Leasing to maintain its relationship with its existing POS partners and grow its gross merchandise volume, or ""GMV"", (which we define as the retail price of merchandise acquired by Progressive Leasing, which we then lease to our customers) from those existing POS partners through their in-store and e-commerce platforms, and also to expand its POS partner base. Progressive Leasing’s ability to retain and grow its relationships with POS partners depends on the willingness of POS partners to partner with it. Depending on the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the seriousness and number of infections resulting from any resurgences in or new variants of the virus, potential POS partners’ focus and resources may be diverted to responding to the pandemic, and thus, potential POS partners and their resources may be delayed in, or unavailable for, evaluating and/or implementing our lease-to-own or other offerings in their store locations and/or e-commerce platforms, which may unfavorably impact our efforts to add new POS partners to our business. The attractiveness of Progressive Leasing’s platform to POS partners depends upon, among other things: its brand and reputation; its ability to sustain its value proposition to POS partners for consumer acquisition; the attractiveness to POS partners of its virtual and data-driven platform; the services, products and customer decisioning standards offered by Progressive Leasing's competitors; the amount of rebates or other incentive payments offered to those POS partners by Progressive Leasing, and its ability to perform under, and maintain, its POS partner agreements, most of which have terms that do not exceed three years.In addition, competition for smaller POS partners has intensified significantly in recent years, with many such POS partners simultaneously offering several products and services that compete directly with the products and services offered by Progressive Leasing. Having a diversified mix of POS partners is important to mitigate risk associated with changing consumer spending behavior, economic conditions and other factors that may affect a particular type of retailer. If Progressive Leasing fails to retain any of its larger POS partners or a substantial number of its smaller POS partners, if it does not acquire new POS partners, if it does not continually grow its GMV from its POS partners, or if it is not able to retain a diverse mix of POS partners, several aspects of our performance would be materially and adversely affected.If Progressive Leasing is unable to attract new consumers and retain and grow its relationships with its existing consumers, several aspects of our performance would be materially and adversely affected. Our continued success depends on the ability of Progressive Leasing to generate repeat use and increased GMV from existing customers and to attract new consumers to its platform. Its ability to retain and grow its relationships with its consumers depends on the willingness of consumers to use its products and services. The attractiveness of Progressive Leasing’s data-driven platform to consumers depends upon, among other things: the number and variety of its POS partners and the mix of products and services available through its platform; its brand and reputation; customer experience and satisfaction; trust and 17perception of the value it provides; technological innovation; and the services, products and customer decisioning standards offered by its competitors. If Progressive Leasing fails to retain its relationship with existing customers, if it does not attract new consumers to its platform, products and services, or if it does not continually expand usage and GMV, including, for example, due to a failure to successfully and timely enhance the features of our existing products or create and launch innovative new products, several aspects of our performance would be materially and adversely affected.Vive also serves subprime and near-prime consumers, but Vive’s business model differs significantly from Progressive Leasing’s lease-to-own business, as does Four’s business model. Through its Vive branded credit cards and other private label credit card products, Vive offers POS partners a variety of revolving loans for subprime and near-prime consumers. Therefore, Vive’s business model differs significantly from Progressive Leasing’s lease-to-own business, which creates specific and unique risks including, among others:•Vive's reliance on two bank partners to issue its Vive branded credit cards and other credit products. Vive’s agreements with its issuing bank partners give those partners the right to terminate those agreements without cause by providing Vive with a non-renewal notice within a specified number of days prior to the dates on which those agreements are scheduled to automatically renew. If those agreements both were terminated or otherwise disrupted, there is a risk that Vive would not be able to replace those banks with an alternative bank provider on terms that Vive would consider favorable or in a timely manner without disruption of its business.•Vive has significantly different regulatory risks as compared to Progressive Leasing, including those applicable to consumer credit card transactions. For example, Vive may have compliance obligations with respect to federal and state laws and regulations, including pursuant to its agreements with its issuing bank partners, that govern, among other areas, cardholder agreement terms and disclosures (e.g., the Truth In Lending Act), credit discrimination (e.g., the Equal Credit Opportunity Act), credit reporting (e.g., the Fair Credit Reporting Act), and servicing and collection activities. As a result, Vive is or may be subject to different regulations and different regulators than Progressive Leasing, particularly at the federal level, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. In addition, through its BNPL offerings, Four allows shoppers to pay for merchandise through four interest-free installments, which enables its customers to purchase furniture, clothing, electronics, health and beauty, footwear, jewelry, and other consumer goods from retailers across the United States. Thus, Four’s business model differs significantly from Progressive Leasing’s and Vive’s business models, which also creates different risks than those faced by Progressive Leasing and Vive, including, for example, different regulatory requirements and related risks. The risks that are specific to Vive may also have a material and adverse effect on several aspects of our performance in the future.Interruptions, inventory shortages and other factors affecting the supply chains of our retail partners may have a material and adverse effect on several aspects of our performance.The POS partners with whom our Progressive Leasing, Vive and Four businesses partner are critical to our success. Any extended supply chain interruptions, inventory shortages or other operational disruptions affecting any of our POS partners may have a material adverse impact on our business. We depend on our POS partners’ abilities to deliver products to customers at the right time and in the right quantities. Accordingly, it is important for our POS partners to maintain optimal levels of inventory and respond rapidly to shifting demands. For example, during the first half of 2022, global supply chain issues attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted inventory and stocking levels in the retail industry. Future increases in the number and/or severity of COVID-19 infections in countries from which our POS partners source merchandise, such as China, could result in similar supply chain disruptions and inventory shortages for our POS partners in future periods, which could adversely affect their sales and Progressive Leasing’s GMV, revenue and earnings. The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, among other risks, a material and adverse effect on several aspects of our performance. The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on several aspects of our performance. For example, Progressive Leasing's POS partners may experience significant declines in sales, and Progressive Leasing may experience related declines in GMV, active customer counts, revenues and profitability related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Such declines may be due to, among other factors: supply chain interruptions unfavorably impacting the inventories and merchandise availability of our POS partners; increased absenteeism among our POS partners' employees who service customers; and/or reduced operating hours or store closures by our POS partners.The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts us will depend on a number of factors and developments that we are not able to predict or control, including, among others: the length and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, including additional periods of increases or spikes in the number of COVID-19 cases in future periods in some or all of the regions where Progressive Leasing’s POS partners’ stores operate, and how widespread any such additional wave of infections, including those related to new variants of the virus, may become; governmental, business and other actions, including the possibility of additional state or local emergency or executive orders 18that require its POS partners to close or reduce their hours of operations; the health of, and the effect on, our team members; and the impact and efficacy of any governmental and other actions taken to control the spread and impact of the virus, including the efficacy of vaccines administered to prevent the further spread of the virus.As discussed above, Progressive Leasing’s largest POS partners have a significant impact on our operating revenues even in a normalized operating environment and, in light of COVID-19, their significance has, and is likely to continue to grow. For example, the significant increase in COVID-19 cases from the Omicron variant during the first quarter of 2022 resulted in many of our POS partners temporarily resuming measures such as store closures or reduced hours and scope of operations, and also resulted in increases in employee absenteeism and declines in customer traffic, all of which unfavorably impacted Progressive Leasing's GMV. Any additional, extended operational disruptions to, or financial distress of, any of those POS partners due to COVID-19 may have a material adverse impact on several aspects of our performance.Our capital allocation strategy and financial policies, including our current stock repurchase program, as well as any potential debt repurchase or dividend programs may not be effective at enhancing shareholder value, or providing other benefits we expect. Although our capital allocation strategy and financial policies are intended to enhance shareholder value, lower our cost of capital and demonstrate our commitment to return excess capital to shareholders while maintaining our ability to invest in organic growth and strategic acquisition opportunities, there can be no assurance they will be effective.We have taken significant steps intended to better align our existing capital structure with our go-forward capital allocation strategy. For example, in November 2021, our Board of Directors approved an increase to our share repurchase program, increasing the program from $300 million to $1.0 billion in the aggregate. Promptly thereafter, we commenced a modified “Dutch Auction” tender offer to repurchase up to $425 million of our common stock, funded largely from the proceeds of a $600 million senior notes issuance that was undertaken in connection with the tender offer. The tender offer resulted in the Company repurchasing approximately 13% of its outstanding shares, at $49.00 per share.Following the tender offer, we have resumed purchases under our share repurchase program. Under the program, we may repurchase shares in open market transactions or pursuant to any trading plan that may be adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, we purchased an additional $223.6 million of our common stock, representing 15.5% of our outstanding shares, with remaining authority to purchase additional shares up to our remaining authorization limit of $337.3 million. The timing and actual number of further share repurchases following the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, if any, will depend on a variety of factors, including the price and availability of our shares, trading volume, general market conditions, and projected cash positions in light of other capital allocation opportunities such as organic growth and strategic acquisitions. The program may be suspended or discontinued at any time in the future without prior notice.Repurchases under our share repurchase program will reduce the market liquidity for our stock, potentially affecting its trading volatility and price. Future share repurchases (or any potential debt repurchases or dividend programs) will also diminish our cash reserves, which may impact our ability to pursue organic growth and attractive strategic opportunities. Furthermore, there are other financial and operational risks associated with our capital allocation strategy and financial policies, including in the event that we implement a debt repurchase or dividend program, which are detailed more fully below. See ""Risks Related to Our Indebtedness."" Our cost reduction initiatives may not be adequate or may have unintended consequences that could be disruptive to our businesses. In response to the deteriorating macro-economic environment, we have taken a number of steps to reduce our cost structure in order to drive efficiencies and right-size variable costs, while minimizing the negative impact on growth-related initiatives. These cost reduction initiatives have included, among others, reduction of our workforce and of other SG&A expenditures. While we believe these initiatives have thus far benefited the Company, particularly as they relate to aligning our servicing costs with our expectations regarding GMV and revenue, such initiatives may ultimately prove to be inadequate or have unintended consequences disruptive to our businesses. In addition, we may not be fully successful in realizing the efficiencies we are seeking, which are subject to many estimates and assumptions and other factors we may not be able to control. We may also be required to undertake additional cost reduction steps, including a further reduction of our workforce, which could also be disruptive to our businesses and potentially lower the anticipated benefits with respect to our future performance, including with respect to GMV and revenue.19The loss of the services of our key executives or our inability to attract and retain key talent, particularly with respect to our information technology function, may have a material adverse impact on our operations.Competition for senior executives and key talent in the information technology, finance and sales areas in our industry is intense and the failure to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly qualified personnel may adversely affect our business and operations. In particular, we rely significantly on the continued service of our data scientists and information technology engineers in order to maintain our complex information technology infrastructure, avoid information technology control deficiencies and develop new products as part of our go-forward business strategy. Competition for these types of highly skilled technology-based employees, as well as an experienced sales force and finance team, in the Salt Lake City area is extremely intense as other national and geographically remote employers who allow such employees to work remotely actively recruit information technology, data science, sales and finance employees, where those employers are not headquartered and do not otherwise maintain a physical presence. Trained and experienced personnel are in high demand and may be in short supply. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced employees have greater resources than we do and may be able to offer more attractive terms of employment. In addition, we invest significant time and expense in training our employees, which increases their value to competitors that may seek to recruit them. We may not be able to attract, develop, and maintain the skilled workforce necessary to operate our business, including with respect to the maintenance and development of our information technology infrastructure, and labor expenses may increase as a result of a shortage in the supply of qualified personnel. If we are unable to continue to attract experienced data scientists and information technology engineers, or unable to maintain and build our highly experienced sales force and finance team, several aspects of our performance may be materially and adversely affected. We do not carry key man life insurance on any of our personnel.In addition, our failure to put in place adequate succession plans for key executives or the failure of key employees to successfully transition into new roles, for example, as a result of reductions in workforce, organizational changes and attrition, could have an adverse effect on our businesses and operating results. The unexpected or abrupt departure of one or more of our key personnel and the failure to effectively transfer knowledge and effect smooth key personnel transitions may have an adverse effect on our businesses resulting from the loss of such person’s skills, knowledge of our businesses, and years of industry experience. If we cannot effectively manage leadership transitions and management changes in the future, our reputation and future business prospects could be adversely affected.Our businesses operate in a highly competitive industry, and their inability to compete successfully would materially and adversely affect several aspects of our performance. The industry in which our Progressive Leasing, Vive and Four businesses operate is highly competitive and highly fluid, particularly in light of the evolving and increasing regulatory environment we are witnessing from regulators such as the FTC and the CFPB, among others, as discussed above. Progressive Leasing and Vive face competition from national, regional and local operators of lease-to-own stores, virtual lease-to-own companies, traditional and e-commerce retailers (including many that offer layaway programs and title or installment lending), traditional and online sellers of used merchandise, and various types of consumer finance companies that may enable our customers to shop at traditional or online retailers, as well as with rental stores that do not offer their customers a purchase option. Similarly, Four faces competition from other companies who offer buy now, pay later products, many of whom are larger than Four, in addition to some of the competitors mentioned above. These competitors may have significantly greater financial and operating resources, greater name recognition in certain markets and more developed products and services, which may allow them to grow faster, including through acquisitions, and to offer more aggressive exclusivity, rebate and/or other incentive payments to existing and potential POS partners, some of whom may be our POS partners. This in turn may enable these competitors to enter new markets, which may decrease opportunities for us in those markets. Greater name recognition, or better public perception of a competitor’s reputation, may help the competitor divert market share, even in established markets. Some competitors may be willing to offer competing products on an unprofitable basis (or may have looser decisioning standards or be willing to relax their decisioning standards) in an effort to gain market share, which could compel us to match their pricing and/or decisioning strategy or lose business. In addition, some of Progressive Leasing’s competitors may be willing to lease certain types of products that we will not agree to lease, enter into customer leases that have services, as opposed to goods, as a significant portion of the lease value, or engage in other practices related to pricing, aggressive rebates and other incentive payments to POS partners, compliance, and other areas that we will not, in an effort to gain market share at our expense. Our business relies heavily on relationships with POS partners. An increase in competition may cause our POS partners to no longer offer our product and services in favor of our competitors, or to offer our product and services and the products of its competitors simultaneously at the same store locations, which may slow growth in our business and limit or reduce profitability. Furthermore, our virtual lease-to-own competitors may deploy different business models, such as direct-to-consumer strategies, that forego reliance on POS partner relationships that may prove to be more successful. 20If Progressive Leasing fails to comply with the FTC settlement, it may be subject to additional injunctive and monetary remedies and be required to change its business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business. In addition, other regulatory authorities and third parties may make allegations similar to those alleged by the FTC, which may result in costly legal fees and lead to monetary settlements, fines, penalties, and/or injunctions that may adversely impact Progressive Leasing’s business operations and financial results.As indicated by the FTC Settlement in April 2020, Progressive Leasing paid $175 million to the FTC and agreed to enhance certain of its compliance-related activities, including augmenting consumer disclosures and",49998,rf,20230222,2023,10K,real_textdata_2023

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and (ii) ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis (""MD&A"") is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of PROG Holdings, Inc. and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Throughout the MD&A we refer to various notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements which appear in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors and ""Forward-Looking Statements"" of this Form 10-K.Business OverviewPROG Holdings, Inc. (""we"", ""our"", ""us"", the ""Company"", or ""PROG Holdings"") is a financial technology holding company that provides transparent and competitive payment options to consumers. PROG Holdings has two reportable segments: (i) Progressive Leasing, an in-store, app-based, and e-commerce point-of-sale lease-to-own solutions provider; and (ii) Vive Financial (""Vive""), an omnichannel provider of second-look revolving credit products.Our Progressive Leasing segment provides consumers with lease-purchase solutions through its point-of-sale partner locations and e-commerce website partners (collectively, ""POS partners""). It does so by purchasing the merchandise from the POS partners desired by customers and, in turn, leasing that merchandise to the customers through a cancellable lease-to-own transaction. Progressive Leasing has no stores of its own, but rather offers lease-purchase solutions to the customers of traditional and e-commerce retailers. The Progressive Leasing segment comprised approximately 97% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022.Our Vive segment primarily serves customers that may not qualify for traditional prime lending offers who desire to purchase goods and services from participating merchants. Vive offers customized programs with services that include revolving loans through private label and Vive-branded credit cards. Vive's current network of POS partner locations and e-commerce websites includes furniture, mattresses, home exercise equipment, and home improvement retailers, as well as medical and dental service providers. The Vive segment comprised approximately 3% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022.On June 25, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of Four Technologies, Inc. (""Four""), an innovative Buy Now, Pay Later company that allows shoppers to pay for merchandise through four interest-free installments. Four’s proprietary platform capabilities and its base of customers and retailers expand PROG Holdings’ ecosystem of financial technology offerings by introducing a payment solution that further diversifies the Company's consumer financial technology offerings. Shoppers use Four to purchase furniture, clothing, electronics, health and beauty products, footwear, jewelry, and other consumer goods from retailers across the United States. Four is not a reportable segment for the year ended December 31, 2022 as its financial results are not material to the Company's consolidated financial results. Four's financial results are reported within ""Other"" for segment reporting purposes.Separation and Distribution of the Aaron's Business SegmentOn November 30, 2020, PROG Holdings (previously ""Aaron's Holdings Company, Inc."") completed the separation of its Aaron's Business segment from its Progressive Leasing and Vive segments. The separation was effected through a tax-free distribution of all outstanding shares of common stock of The Aaron's Company, Inc. (""The Aaron's Company"") to the PROG Holdings shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 27, 2020 (referred to as the ""separation and distribution transaction""). Through that distribution, shareholders of PROG Holdings received one share of The Aaron's Company for every two shares of PROG Holdings common stock. Upon completion of the separation and distribution transaction on November 30, 2020, The Aaron's Company became an independent, publicly traded company under the symbol ""AAN"" on the New York Stock Exchange, while PROG Holdings continued to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the new symbol ""PRG"".Prior to the separation and distribution transaction, the Company's operating segments were Progressive Leasing, the Aaron's Business, and Vive. All direct revenues and expenses of the Aaron's Business operations have been classified within discontinued operations, net of income tax, within our consolidated statements of earnings (loss) through the separation and distribution date of November 30, 2020. Certain corporate expenses that have previously been reported as expenses of the Aaron's Business segment in 2020 did not qualify for classification within discontinued operations and are reported as unallocated corporate expenses for segment purposes within continuing operations. These unallocated corporate expenses are in addition to corporate overhead costs allocated to the Progressive Leasing and Vive segments through the separation and distribution date of November 30, 2020.37Macroeconomic and Business EnvironmentThe Company continues to operate in a challenging macroeconomic environment. The rapid increase in the rate of inflation during 2022, particularly in gas, food, and housing costs, which we believe disproportionately negatively affects the customers we serve and therefore our customers' ability to make the payments they owe to the Company, has resulted in an unfavorable impact on our lease portfolio performance and Gross Merchandise Volume (""GMV"") during 2022. Customer payment delinquencies and uncollectible renewal payments experienced within our Progressive Leasing segment during much of 2022 significantly exceeded levels experienced during pre-pandemic periods. In response to increasing customer delinquencies and higher write-offs, Progressive Leasing tightened its lease decisioning several times during 2022, resulting in fewer lease approvals and an adverse impact on GMV. Levels of customer payment delinquencies and uncollectible renewal payments for leases originated after Progressive Leasing further tightened its lease decisioning in mid-2022 improved to levels consistent with pre-pandemic lease portfolio performance. The relatively high levels of customer payment delinquencies and related write-offs experienced during the year ended December 31, 2022 related to leases originated prior to the Company's further tightening of its lease decisioning in mid-2022 may continue for an extended period of time, and/or may increase to even higher levels, which would have an unfavorable impact on our performance. Furthermore, increasing unemployment rates and/or a U.S. recession may result in increasing levels of customer payment delinquencies and related write-offs, which would result in an unfavorable impact on our performance.The significant increase in inflation and interest rates, and fears of a possible recession have also unfavorably impacted consumer confidence within our customer base, resulting in a decrease in demand for the types of merchandise offered by many of our key national and regional POS partners. In light of these macroeconomic challenges and to align the cost structure of our business with our near-term revenue outlook, the Company executed on a number of cost reduction initiatives during the second and third quarters of 2022 to drive efficiencies and right-size variable costs, while attempting to minimize the negative impact on growth-related initiatives.COVID-19 Pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy in recent years, including the businesses and operations of our POS partners and our own businesses. For example, the significant increase in COVID-19 cases from the Omicron variant during the first quarter of 2022 resulted in many of our POS partners temporarily closing showrooms and/or reducing the hours and scope of operations of their showrooms, and also resulted in increases in employee absenteeism and declines in customer traffic for many of our POS partners, all of which unfavorably impacted Progressive Leasing's GMV. In addition, other pandemic-related factors unfavorably impacted many of our POS partners during the first half of 2022, including supply chain disruptions resulting in shortages of available products at certain POS partners, primarily in appliances, electronics and furniture categories. Those and other pandemic-related developments, may adversely impact Progressive Leasing's generation of new lease agreements, Vive's generation of new loans, and our results of operations, financial condition, cash flow and/or liquidity in future periods.The extent of any such adverse, pandemic-related impacts will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, for example, the emergence of more contagious and harmful variants of COVID-19, and localized outbreaks or additional waves of COVID-19 cases and the impact of any such outbreaks on our customers, POS partners, and employees.We believe pandemic-related government stimulus payments and enhanced unemployment benefits and child tax credits provided in 2020 and 2021 provided economic support to many of our customers, resulting in an increase in payment activity and early lease buyouts despite the economically challenging environment, as well as lease merchandise, accounts receivable, and loan receivable write-offs trending lower during 2020 and 2021. In turn, we further believe that the expiration of the government stimulus payments, enhanced unemployment benefits and child tax credits that were implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic also contributed to unfavorable results of operations in 2022 as compared to 2021.38HighlightsThe following summarizes significant highlights from the year ended December 31, 2022: •We reported revenues of $2.6 billion in 2022, a decrease of 3.0% compared to 2021. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to lower GMV as described below, an increase in customer payment delinquencies and uncollectible renewal payments, tightening of lease decisioning beginning in mid-2022 resulting in fewer lease originations, and a decrease in customers exercising early lease buyout options, as compared to the strong customer payment activity and low delinquencies we experienced in 2021. •GMV decreased by $167.2 million for Progressive Leasing and $21.1 million for Vive in 2022, compared to 2021. These decreases were due to tighter lease and loan decisioning, resulting in fewer lease and loan originations, the rapid increase in the rate of inflation eroding customers' disposable incomes and reducing their demand for many of the goods sold by our POS partners, and the absence of government stimulus payments and enhanced unemployment benefits and child tax credits, which we believe benefited many of our customers in 2021. These negative impacts were partially offset by a $13.0 million increase in Progressive Leasing GMV generated through e-commerce platforms. In 2022, e-commerce GMV represented 17.2% of Progressive Leasing's total GMV, compared to 15.2% in 2021. GMV from our other operations increased by $51.8 million resulting from the growth in loan originations by our Four business during 2022. •Earnings before income tax expense decreased to $148.2 million compared to $328.2 million in 2021. The decrease was primarily driven by an overall decline in revenues as discussed above. The decrease was also driven by an increase of $66.9 million in the provision for lease merchandise write-offs, as a result of higher customer payment delinquencies and write-offs in 2022, as compared to the strong customer payment activity and historically low lease merchandise write-offs we experienced during 2021. The decrease was further driven by an increase of $23.6 million in the provision for loan losses due to higher loan write-offs during 2022 and the recognition of estimated credit losses as of December 31, 2022, resulting from unfavorable forecasted macroeconomic conditions. Other factors contributing to the decrease were a $32.1 million increase in interest expense related to the Senior Notes issued in November 2021, a $19.8 million increase in sales, general, and administrative expenses, and a $10.2 million goodwill impairment loss related to Four.Key Operating MetricsGross Merchandise Volume. We believe GMV is a key performance indicator of our Progressive Leasing and Vive segments, as it provides the total value of new leases and loans written into our portfolio over a specified time period. GMV does not represent revenues earned by the Company, but rather is a leading indicator we use in forecasting revenues the Company may earn in the short-term. Progressive Leasing's GMV is defined as the retail price of merchandise acquired by Progressive Leasing, which it then expects to lease to its customers. GMV for Vive and Other are defined as gross loan originations. The following table presents our GMV for the Company for the years presented:For the Year Ended December 31 (Unaudited and In Thousands)202220212020Progressive Leasing$1,976,794 $2,143,948 $1,851,308 Vive178,002 199,139 130,751 Other60,459 8,651 — Total GMV$2,215,255 $2,351,738 $1,982,059 The decrease in Progressive Leasing's and Vive's GMV was primarily due to our tighter lease and loan decisioning to address the unfavorable economic conditions that were present in 2022, resulting in fewer lease and loan approvals; the rapid increase in the rate of inflation, which eroded customers' disposable incomes and their demand for many of the goods sold by our POS partners; and the absence of government stimulus payments and enhanced unemployment benefits and child tax credits, which we believe benefited many of our customers in 2021. We believe all of these factors have unfavorably impacted the generation of new leases and loans. The decrease in Progressive Leasing's GMV from those factors was partially offset by a $13.0 million increase in GMV generated through e-commerce platforms. E-commerce channels generated 17.2% of Progressive Leasing's GMV in 2022 compared to 15.2% in 2021. The decrease in total GMV was also partially offset by an increase in GMV from our other operations, primarily due to an increase in loan originations by our Four business.39Active Customer Count. Our active customer count represents the total number of customers that have an active lease agreement with Progressive Leasing, or an active loan with Vive or Four. The following table presents our consolidated active customer count, which includes an immaterial number of customers that have both an active lease agreement and loan agreement, for the Company for the years presented:As of December 31 (Unaudited)202220212020Active Customer Count:Progressive Leasing943,000 1,044,000 970,000 Vive92,000 88,000 66,000 Other39,000 18,000 — Total Active Customer Count1,074,000 1,150,000 1,036,000 The decrease in the number of Progressive Leasing customers in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to a decrease in customer demand for the types of merchandise typically purchased through our lease-to-own solutions and the tightening of our lease decisioning to address the unfavorable economic conditions that were present during 2022. The increase in the number of Vive customers was primarily driven by the growth in loan originations we experienced in 2021. The increase in customers from our other operations is driven primarily by the continued growth in loan originations from our Four business. Key Components of Earnings from Continuing Operations Before Income Tax ExpenseIn this MD&A section, we review our consolidated results. For the year ended December 31, 2022 and the comparable prior year periods, some of the key revenue, cost and expense items that affected earnings before income taxes were as follows:Revenues. We separate our total revenues into two components: (i) lease revenues and fees and (ii) interest and fees on loans receivable. Lease revenues and fees include all revenues derived from lease agreements from our Progressive Leasing segment. Lease revenues are recorded net of a provision for uncollectible renewal payments. Interest and fees on loans receivable represents merchant fees, finance charges and annual and other fees earned on outstanding loans in our Vive segment and, to a lesser extent, from Four.Depreciation of Lease Merchandise. Depreciation of lease merchandise primarily reflects the expense associated with depreciating merchandise leased to customers by Progressive Leasing.Provision for Lease Merchandise Write-offs. The provision for lease merchandise write-offs represents the estimated merchandise losses incurred but not yet identified by management and adjustments for changes in estimates for the allowance for lease merchandise write-offs.Operating Expenses. Operating expenses include personnel costs, stock-based compensation expense, occupancy costs, advertising, professional services expense, sales acquisition expense, computer software expense, bank service charges, the provision for loan losses, fixed asset depreciation expense, intangible asset amortization, and restructuring, among other expenses. Impairment of Goodwill. Impairment of goodwill is the partial write-off of the goodwill balance at the Four reporting unit. Refer to Note 1 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the goodwill impairment assessment and resulting impairment charge.Separation Related Charges. Separation related charges include stock-based compensation expense and retirement charges associated with the separation of the Aaron's Business segment. Refer to Note 2 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the separation and distribution of the Aaron's Business segment.Interest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net consists of interest expense incurred on the Company's Senior Notes and senior secured revolving credit facility (the ""Revolving Facility""). Interest expense is presented net of interest income earned on the Company's deposits in cash and cash equivalents.40Results of OperationsResults of Operations – Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 Change Year Ended December 31,2022 vs. 2021(In Thousands)20222021$%REVENUES:Lease Revenues and Fees$2,523,785 $2,619,005 $(95,220)(3.6)%Interest and Fees on Loans Receivable74,041 58,915 15,126 25.7 2,597,826 2,677,920 (80,094)(3.0)COSTS AND EXPENSES:Depreciation of Lease Merchandise1,757,730 1,820,010 (62,280)(3.4)Provision for Lease Merchandise Write-offs193,926 126,984 66,942 52.7 Operating Expenses450,374 397,399 52,975 13.3 Impairment of Goodwill10,151 — 10,151 nmf2,412,181 2,344,393 67,788 2.9 OPERATING PROFIT185,645 333,527 (147,882)(44.3)Interest Expense, Net(37,401)(5,323)(32,078)nmfEARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAX EXPENSE148,244 328,204 (179,960)(54.8)INCOME TAX EXPENSE 49,535 84,647 (35,112)(41.5)NET EARNINGS$98,709 $243,557 $(144,848)(59.5)%nmf—Calculation is not meaningful41RevenuesInformation about our revenues by source and reportable segment is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2022Year Ended December 31, 2021(In Thousands)Progressive LeasingViveOtherTotalProgressive LeasingViveOtherTotalLease Revenues and Fees$2,523,785 $— $— $2,523,785 $2,619,005 $— $— $2,619,005 Interest and Fees on Loans Receivable— 70,911 3,130 74,041 — 58,462 453 58,915 Total Revenues$2,523,785 $70,911 $3,130 $2,597,826 $2,619,005 $58,462 $453 $2,677,920 The decrease in Progressive Leasing revenues was primarily due to an increase in customer payment delinquencies and uncollectible renewal payments, as compared to the strong customer payment activity and low delinquencies it experienced in 2021. The provision for uncollectible renewal payments, which is recorded as a reduction to lease revenues and fees, was $376.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $224.7 million in 2021. The decrease in Progressive Leasing revenues was also due to a 7.8% decline in its GMV during the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to 2021, and fewer customers electing to exercise early lease buyouts during 2022, as compared to 2021. The increase in Vive revenues was primarily driven by a larger loan portfolio throughout 2022 as compared to 2021.Operating ExpensesInformation about certain significant components of operating expenses is as follows:Change Year Ended December 31,2022 vs. 2021(In Thousands)20222021$%Personnel Costs1$194,195 $189,576 $4,619 2.4 %Stock-Based Compensation 17,521 21,349 (3,828)(17.9)Occupancy Costs6,466 6,633 (167)(2.5)Advertising15,762 17,502 (1,740)(9.9)Professional Services22,824 24,106 (1,282)(5.3)Sales Acquisition Expense228,828 22,374 6,454 28.8 Computer Software Expense327,629 20,674 6,955 33.6 Bank Service Charges12,491 11,542 949 8.2 Other Sales, General and Administrative Expense40,574 32,717 7,857 24.0 Sales, General and Administrative Expense4366,290 346,473 19,817 5.7 Provision for Loan Losses41,232 17,668 23,564 133.4 Depreciation and Amortization33,851 33,258 593 1.8 Restructuring Expense9,001 — 9,001 nmfOperating Expenses$450,374 $397,399 $52,975 13.3 %1 Personnel costs excludes stock-based compensation expense, which is reported separately in the operating expense table.2 Sales acquisition expense includes vendor incentives and rebates to POS partners, external sales commissions, amortization of initial direct costs and amounts paid to various POS partners to be their exclusive provider of lease-to-own solutions.3 Computer software expense consists primarily of software subscription fees, licensing fees and non-capitalizable software implementation costs.4 Progressive Leasing's sales, general and administrative expense was $321.3 million and $316.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.The increase in personnel costs of $4.6 million was driven primarily by an increase of $2.9 million in personnel costs attributable to an increase in the number of employees resulting from the Four acquisition and other strategic initiatives started by the Company in 2021 that continued incurring costs during 2022. Personnel costs also increased by $2.2 million at Vive, primarily due to wage inflation. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.8 million at Progressive Leasing, primarily due to its reduction in the number of employees during the second half of 2022 as part of its restructuring and cost cutting initiatives.Sales acquisition expense increased $6.5 million primarily due to increased incentives, sales commissions, and other expenses at Progressive Leasing to promote lease originations with its POS partners.42Computer software expense increased $7.0 million primarily due to an increase in non-capitalizable costs for software implementation projects by Progressive Leasing during 2022, other strategic initiatives started by the Company in 2021 that continued incurring costs in 2022, and increased software licensing costs.Other sales, general and administrative expense increased $7.9 million primarily due to additional administrative costs within Progressive Leasing during 2022, in addition to an increase of $2.4 million due to the acquisition and growth of our Four business, and other strategic initiatives started by the Company in 2021 that incurred greater costs in 2022 than in 2021.Provision for loan losses increased $23.6 million due to unfavorable economic conditions present during 2022 and projected macroeconomic conditions, including a rapid increase in the rate of inflation, high unemployment rates, and the absence of government stimulus payments and enhanced unemployment benefits and child tax credits, as compared to 2021, at Vive. The provision for loan losses also increased due to growth in GMV at Four since it was acquired in June 2021. The provision for loan losses as a percentage of interest and fees revenue increased to 55.7% for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 30.0% in 2021, due to customer payment delinquencies at Vive returning to pre-pandemic levels, higher expected credit losses due to projected unfavorable macroeconomic conditions, and higher write-offs within our Four operations.Restructuring expense of $9.0 million is the result of a number of restructuring activities initiated by the Company during 2022 intended to reduce expenses, consolidate certain segment corporate headquarters and other office locations, and align the cost structure of the business with the Company's strategy and near-term revenue outlook. The restructuring expense was primarily comprised of severance costs associated with a reduction in Progressive Leasing's workforce and operating lease right-of-use asset impairment charges related to a reduction in call center and office space and the relocation of the Vive corporate headquarters to the Company's corporate office building.Other Costs and ExpensesDepreciation of lease merchandise. Depreciation of lease merchandise decreased by 3.4% due to fewer customers exercising early lease buyout elections during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021. As a percentage of total lease revenues and fees, depreciation of lease merchandise increased slightly compared to 2021, resulting from the decline in early buyout elections.Provision for lease merchandise write-offs. The provision for lease merchandise write-offs increased by $66.9 million due to higher customer payment delinquencies and write-offs during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the strong customer payment activity and historically low lease merchandise write-offs we experienced in 2021. Given the significant economic uncertainty resulting from challenges in the macroeconomic environment, including high inflation, forecasted unemployment rates, and/or a recession and the potential effects of such developments on our POS partners, customers, and business going forward, a high level of estimation was involved in determining the allowance as of December 31, 2022. Actual lease merchandise write-offs could differ materially from the allowance.The provision for lease merchandise write-offs as a percentage of lease revenues was 7.7% for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 4.8% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in the provision as a percentage of lease revenues was primarily due to higher customer payment delinquencies and write-offs on leases originated in 2022, most notably in the first half of 2022 prior to the Company further tightening its lease decisioning to address the unfavorable economic conditions. The provision also increased as a result of changes in estimates for the allowance as discussed above.Impairment of Goodwill. The Company recorded a loss of $10.2 million to partially write off the goodwill balance of the Four reporting unit during the third quarter of 2022. Refer to Note 1 for additional information regarding the details of the goodwill impairment loss.43Earnings from Continuing Operations Before Income Tax ExpenseInformation about our earnings from continuing operations before income tax expense by reportable segment is as follows: Change Year Ended December 31,2022 vs. 2021(In Thousands)20222021$%EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAX EXPENSE:Progressive Leasing$174,143 $319,125 $(144,982)(45.4)%Vive9,195 20,225 (11,030)(54.5)Other(35,094)(11,146)(23,948)nmfEarnings from Continuing Operations Before Income Tax Expense$148,244 $328,204 $(179,960)(54.8)%nmf—Calculation is not meaningfulThe $35.1 million loss before income taxes within ""Other"" primarily relates to our Four operations and includes a $10.2 million impairment loss related to the partial impairment of Four's goodwill. Other factors impacting the change in earnings before income tax expense are discussed above. Income Tax ExpenseIncome tax expense decreased to $49.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $84.6 million in 2021 primarily due to lower earnings before income tax expense. The effective tax rate was 33.4% for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 25.8% in 2021. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by the non-deductible goodwill impairment loss for Four of $10.2 million, interest on the Company's uncertain tax position liabilities, an unfavorable adjustment for employee stock-based compensation vesting, and an increase in the valuation allowance related to certain deferred tax assets.Results of Operations – Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 Change Year Ended December 31,2021 vs. 2020(In Thousands)20212020$%REVENUES:Lease Revenues and Fees$2,619,005 $2,443,405 $175,600 7.2 %Interest and Fees on Loans Receivable58,915 41,190 17,725 43.0 2,677,920 2,484,595 193,325 7.8 COSTS AND EXPENSES:Depreciation of Lease Merchandise1,820,010 1,690,922 129,088 7.6 Provision for Lease Merchandise Write-offs126,984 131,332 (4,348)(3.3)Operating Expenses397,399 372,625 24,774 6.6 Separation Related Charges— 17,953 (17,953)nmf2,344,393 2,212,832 131,561 5.9 OPERATING PROFIT333,527 271,763 61,764 22.7 Interest Expense, Net(5,323)(187)(5,136)nmfEARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAX EXPENSE328,204 271,576 56,628 20.9 INCOME TAX EXPENSE84,647 37,949 46,698 123.1 NET EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS243,557 233,627 9,930 4.3 LOSS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF INCOME TAX— (295,092)295,092 nmfNET EARNINGS (LOSS)$243,557 $(61,465)$305,022 nmfnmf—Calculation is not meaningful44RevenuesInformation about our revenues by source and reportable segment is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2021Year Ended December 31, 2020(In Thousands)Progressive LeasingViveOtherTotalProgressive LeasingViveOtherTotalLease Revenues and Fees$2,619,005 $— $— $2,619,005 $2,443,405 $— $— $2,443,405 Interest and Fees on Loans Receivable— 58,462 453 58,915 — 41,190 — 41,190 Total Revenues$2,619,005 $58,462 $453 $2,677,920 $2,443,405 $41,190 $— $2,484,595 The increase in Progressive Leasing revenues was due to a 15.8% increase in GMV driven by growth from large national POS partners and e-commerce platforms. GMV generated through e-commerce platforms represented 15.2% of total Progressive Leasing GMV in 2021, compared to 7.0% in 2020. Although Progressive Leasing's customer payment delinquencies and uncollectible renewal payments began trending back to normalized pre-pandemic levels in the second half of 2021, and reached those pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter, the unfavorable impact of that factor on revenues was more than offset by Progressive Leasing's lease portfolio growth in 2021. The increase in Vive revenues was due to continued strong customer payment performance and a 52.3% increase in GMV in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 2020, resulting in growth in our loans receivable portfolio and additional interest and fee revenues. We believe a significant portion of our Progressive Leasing and Vive customers received stimulus payments and/or federally supplemented unemployment payments, which contributed to the strong customer payment activity we experienced in 2020 and the first half of 2021.Operating ExpensesInformation about certain significant components of operating expenses is as follows:Change Year Ended December 31,2021 vs. 2020(In Thousands)20212020$%Personnel Costs1$189,576 $170,285 $19,291 11.3 %Stock-Based Compensation21,349 20,403 946 4.6 Occupancy Costs6,633 6,545 88 1.3 Advertising17,502 6,627 10,875 164.1 Professional Services24,106 22,503 1,603 7.1 Sales Acquisition Expense222,374 19,449 2,925 15.0 Computer Software Expense320,674 13,260 7,414 55.9 Bank Service Charges11,542 9,916 1,626 16.4 Other Sales, General and Administrative Expense32,717 37,779 (5,062)(13.4)Sales, General and Administrative Expense4346,473 306,767 39,706 12.9 Provision for Loan Losses17,668 34,038 (16,370)(48.1)Depreciation and Amortization33,258 31,820 1,438 4.5 Operating Expenses$397,399 $372,625 $24,774 6.6 %1 Personnel costs excludes stock-based compensation expense, which is reported separately in the operating expense table.2 Sales acquisition expense includes vendor incentives and rebates to POS partners, external sales commissions, amortization of initial direct costs and amounts paid to various POS partners to be their exclusive provider of lease-to-own solutions.3 Computer software expense consists primarily of software subscription fees, licensing fees and non-capitalizable software implementation costs.4 Progressive Leasing's sales, general and administrative expense was $316.3 million and $268.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.The increase in personnel costs of $19.3 million was driven by increases of $21.5 million and $0.9 million at Progressive Leasing and Vive, respectively, for additional hiring and promotions resulting from continued growth in the business and new personnel costs for functions associated with becoming a standalone public company effective November 30, 2020. Personnel costs increased an additional $1.8 million as a result of strategic initiatives started by the Company in 2021. These increases were partially offset by executive personnel costs incurred by the Aaron's Business segment in the year ended December 31, 2020, which did not qualify for classification within discontinued operations, and are classified within unallocated corporate costs for segment purposes.45Advertising expense increased $10.9 million primarily due to Progressive Leasing's effort to continue growing GMV from existing POS partners and to further expand into e-commerce, combined with reduced marketing efforts in the same period of 2020 associated with cost cutting measures implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.Computer software expense increased $7.4 million primarily due to non-capitalizable software implementation projects by Progressive Leasing during 2021 and increased software and licensing costs related to the overall growth and strategic initiatives of the Company.Provision for loan losses decreased $16.4 million due to continued strong customer payment activity and changes to estimates in Vive's allowance for loan losses during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 2020. The Company recognized an incremental $12.3 million allowance for loan losses during the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the unfavorable forecasted macroeconomic conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. In the year ended December 31, 2021, strong customer payment activity and improved forecasted macroeconomic conditions resulted in a downward change in estimate to the allowance for loan losses of $14.7 million. These changes in forecasted macroeconomic conditions and strong customer payment activity resulted in a decrease in Vive's allowance for loan losses as a percentage of gross loans receivable from 32.1% as of December 31, 2020 to 23.4% as of December 31, 2021. We believe a significant portion of our Vive customers received stimulus payments and/or federally supplemented unemployment payments, which contributed to the strong customer payment activity in 2020 and 2021. These decreases were partially offset by the establishment of new allowances due to Vive's GMV growth of 52.3% in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year. Other Costs and Expenses Depreciation of lease merchandise. Depreciation of lease merchandise increased due to growth in Progressive Leasing's portfolio of leased assets for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020. As a percentage of total lease revenues and fees, depreciation of lease merchandise increased to 69.5% from 69.2% in 2020, primarily due to elevated early lease buyouts in 2021 as compared to 2020, partially offset by a decrease in the provision for uncollectible renewal payments.Provision for lease merchandise write-offs. The provision for lease merchandise write-offs decreased $4.3 million primarily due to a $14.8 million decline in write-offs, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of continued strong payment activity from customers, and changes to estimates in our allowance for lease merchandise write-offs. At December 31, 2020, we established incremental lease merchandise allowances of $10.3 million, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, based on management's best estimate of the potential unfavorable impacts the COVID-19 pandemic may have on our customers' ability to continue making payments on their leases. In the year ended December 31, 2021, we continued to experience strong customer payment activity and relatively low write-offs, resulting in the reversal of the full amount of the incremental COVID-19 specific allowance for write-offs. We believe a significant portion of our Progressive Leasing customers received stimulus payments and/or federally supplemented unemployment payments, which contributed to the strong customer payment activity we experienced in 2020 and 2021.The provision for lease merchandise write-offs as a percentage of lease revenues decreased to 4.8% for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 5.4% in 2020 due to improved customer payment activity, relatively low write-offs, and changes in estimates on the allowance as discussed above.Separation related charges. The Company incurred $18.0 million of stock-based compensation and retirement costs in the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the Company's separation of the Aaron's Business segment.Earnings from Continuing Operations Before Income Tax ExpenseInformation about our earnings from continuing operations before income tax expense by reportable segment is as follows: Change Year Ended December 31,2021 vs. 2020(In Thousands)20212020$%EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAX EXPENSE:Progressive Leasing$319,125 $320,636 $(1,511)(0.5)%Vive20,225 (11,180)31,405 nmfOther(11,146)— (11,146)nmfUnallocated Corporate Expenses— (37,880)37,880 nmfEarnings from Continuing Operations Before Income Tax Expense$328,204 $271,576 $56,628 20.9 %46The $11.1 million loss before income taxes within ""Other"" primarily relates to our Four operations. Unallocated corporate expenses represent certain expenses that had previously been reported within the Aaron's Business segment in 2020 that did not qualify for classification within discontinued operations. Factors impacting the change in earnings from continuing operations before income tax expense are discussed above.Income Tax ExpenseIncome tax expense increased to $84.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $37.9 million in 2020. The effective tax rate of 14.0% during the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to a $34.2 million discrete income tax benefit generated by the provisions of the CARES Act in 2020, which resulted from the rate differential on the carryback of the Company's 2018 net operating loss previously recorded at 21% to the 2013 tax year, where the benefit was recognized at 35%. There are no material adjustments between the Company's effective tax rate of 25.8% and the Company's statutory income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021.Overview of Financial PositionThe major changes in the consolidated balance sheet from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022, include:•Cash and cash equivalents decreased $38.3 million to $131.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. For additional information, refer to the ""Liquidity and Capital Resources"" section below.•Lease merchandise, net, decreased $66.0 million due primarily to a 7.8% decrease in Progressive Leasing's GMV in 2022 as compared to 2021. •Loans receivable, net of allowances and unamortized fees, increased $11.7 million due to growth in the loan portfolios of Vive and Four compared to December 31, 2021. •Goodwill decreased $10.2 million as a result of the impairment loss to partially write off the goodwill balance of the Four reporting unit during the third quarter of 2022. Refer to Note 1 for additional information regarding the details of the impairment loss.47Liquidity and Capital ResourcesGeneralWe expect that our primary capital requirements will consist of:•Reinvesting in our business, including buying merchandise for the operations of Progressive Leasing. Because we believe Progressive Leasing will continue to grow over the long-term, we expect that the need for additional lease merchandise will remain a major capital requirement; •Making merger and acquisition investment(s) to further broaden our product offerings; and•Returning excess cash to shareholders through periodically repurchasing stock.Other capital requirements include (i) expenditures related to software development; (ii) expenditures related to our corporate operating activities; (iii) personnel expenditures; (iv) income tax payments; (v) funding of loans receivable for Vive; and (vi) servicing our outstanding debt obligation.Our capital requirements have been financed through:•cash flows from operations;•private debt offerings;•bank debt; and•stock offerings.As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $131.9 million of cash, $350.0 million of availability under the Revolving Facility, and $600.0 million of indebtedness. The Company's statement of cash flows for the year ended 2020 was not required to be adjusted for discontinued operations. Accordingly, the cash flow activities for the Aaron's Business discontinued operations are included in the discussion and analysis set forth below for the comparative periods through the separation and distribution date of November 30, 2020.Cash Provided by Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities was $242.5 million and $246.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Cash provided by operating activities decreased by $3.5 million despite the $144.8 million decrease in net earnings from continuing operations as compared to 2021. Other significant changes in operating cash outflows compared to the prior year include $35.6 million of interest paid on the Company's Senior Notes compared to $1.5 million in 2021, and an $8.6 million increase in net income tax payments for the year ended December 31, 2022. These decreases in operating cash flows were partially offset by a $165.3 million decrease in purchases of lease merchandise by Progressive Leasing during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021. Other changes in cash provided by operating activities are discussed above in our discussion of results for the year ended December 31, 2022.Cash provided by operating activities was $246.0 million and $456.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The $210.0 million decrease in operating cash flows was primarily due to the separation of the Aaron's Business, which accounted for $193.3 million of the cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2020. The $16.7 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in 2021 when compared to 2020 was driven by an increase of lease merchandise purchases of $265.5 million during 2021. The Company also made net income tax payments of $53.6 million during 2021, compared to $29.0 million in 2020. These higher cash outflows in 2021 were partially offset by stronger customer payment activity during the first half of 2021 and the payment of Progressive Leasing's $175.0 million settlement with the FTC in the second quarter of 2020. Changes in certain working capital accounts also contributed to operating cash inflows. Other changes in cash provided by operating activities are discussed above in our discussion of results for the year ended December 31, 2021.Cash Used in Investing ActivitiesCash used in investing activities was $53.5 million and $82.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The $28.7 million decrease in investing cash outflows in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 was primarily due to the $22.8 million of cash paid for the acquisition of Four in June 2021. Additionally, proceeds from loans receivable increased $27.4 million in 2022 compared to 2021. These changes were partially offset by a $21.4 million increase in cash outflows for investments in loans receivables in 2022 as compared to 2021. Cash used in investing activities was $82.2 million and $114.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 included $64.5 million in cash outflows attributable to the Aaron's Business discontinued operations. The $32.2 million increase in cash used in investing activities from continuing operations when compared to the same period in 2020 was primarily due to: (i) a $69.6 million increase in cash outflows for investments in Vive loans receivable in 2021 due to growth in loan origination activity; and (ii) the $22.8 million cash paid, net of cash acquired, for the acquisition of Four in June 2021. The increases were partially offset by a $62.9 million increase in proceeds on loans receivable driven by strong customer payment activity and growth in the portfolio in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period of 2020.Cash Used in Financing ActivitiesCash used in financing activities was $227.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $30.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $196.9 million. Cash used in financing activities in 2022 was primarily due to the $223.6 million outflows for the acquisition of treasury stock. Cash used in financing activities in 2021 was primarily comprised of: (i) a $425 million outflow for the ""Dutch auction"" tender offer, plus $3.6 million in related transaction fees, for the repurchase and retirement of our common stock; (ii) a $142.4 million outflow for the acquisition of treasury stock; (iii) the repayment of $50.0 million on our Revolving Facility; and (iv) $600 million gross proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes, net of $8.3 million of bank fees.Cash used in financing activities was $30.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $362.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $332.3 million. Cash used in financing activities in 2021 was primarily comprised of: (i) a $425 million outflow for the ""Dutch auction"" tender offer, plus $3.6 million in related transaction fees, for the repurchase and retirement of our common stock; (ii) a $142.4 million outflow for the acquisition of treasury stock; (iii) the repayment of $50.0 million on our Revolving Facility; and (iv) $600 million gross proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes, net of $8.3 million of bank fees. Cash used in financing activities in 2020 was primarily comprised of: (i) $342.0 million of net repayments made to fully extinguish the Company's historical debt facilities in advance of the separation and distribution transaction; (ii) $50.0 million of borrowings on the Company's Revolving Facility; (iii) $54.2 million of cash transferred to The Aaron's Company in the separation and distribution; (iv) $13.8 million of dividends paid; and (v) $12.4 million of proceeds from stock option exercises.Share RepurchasesWe purchase our stock in the market from time to time as authorized by our Board of Directors. On February 22, 2021, the Company's Board of Directors terminated the share repurchase program that was in effect as of December 31, 2020 and replaced it with a repurchase program that permitted the Company to repurchase up to $300 million of the Company's outstanding common stock. On November 3, 2021, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program that replaced the previous $300 million repurchase program. As of December 31, 2022, we had the authority to purchase additional shares up to our remaining authorization limit of $337.3 million. The Company purchased 8,720,223 shares of its common stock for $223.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 and 11,611,178 shares for $567.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2021.DividendsWe paid no dividends during 2022 and 2021 and do not currently anticipate paying any dividends. Prior to the separation and distribution transaction, we declared an annual common stock dividend of $0.165 per share in 2020, which resulted in an aggregate dividend payment of $13.8 million.Debt FinancingOn November 26, 2021, the Company entered into an indenture in connection with its offering of $600 million aggregate principal amount of its senior unsecured notes due 2029 (the ""Senior Notes""). The Senior Notes were issued at 100.0% of their par value with a stated fixed annual interest rate of 6.00%. Interest will accrue on the outstanding balance and will be payable semi-annually. The Senior Notes are general unsecured obligations of the Company and will be guaranteed by certain of the Company's existing and future domestic subsidiaries.The indenture discussed above contains various other covenants and obligations to which the Company and its subsidiaries are subject while the Senior Notes are outstanding. The covenants in the indenture may limit the extent to which, or the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to, among other thing",49992,mgmt,20230222,2023,10K,real_textdata_2023
REAL_1075_01_rf_2023_0005,1075,01,1075:01,"Item 1A.Risk Factors34 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSIn addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in the description of these operations contained elsewhere in this report, set forth below are risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results. Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, the following risks and uncertainties apply to Pinnacle West and its subsidiaries, including APS. REGULATORY RISKSOur financial condition depends upon APS’s ability to recover costs in a timely manner from customers through regulated rates and otherwise execute its business strategy.APS is subject to comprehensive regulation by several federal, state and local regulatory agencies that significantly influence its business, liquidity and results of operations and its ability to fully recover costs from utility customers in a timely manner. The ACC regulates APS’s retail electric rates and FERC regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services. The profitability of APS is affected by the rates it may charge and the timeliness of recovering costs incurred through its rates and adjustor recovery mechanisms. Consequently, our financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon the satisfactory resolution of any APS rate proceedings, adjustor recovery and ancillary matters which may come before the ACC and FERC, including in some cases how court challenges to these regulatory decisions are resolved. Arizona, like certain other states, has a statute that allows the ACC to reopen prior decisions and modify otherwise final orders under certain circumstances. Additionally, given that APS is subject to oversight by several regulatory agencies, a resolution by one may not foreclose potential actions by others for similar or related matters. See Note 10.The ACC must also approve APS’s issuance of equity and debt securities and any significant transfer or encumbrance of APS property used to provide retail electric service and must approve or receive prior notification of certain transactions between us, APS, and our respective affiliates, including the infusion of equity into APS. Decisions made by the ACC or FERC could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.34Table of Contents APS’s ability to conduct its business operations and avoid negative operational and financial impacts depends in part upon compliance with federal, state and local laws, judicial decisions, statutes, regulations and ACC requirements, which may be revised from time to time by legislative or other action, and obtaining and maintaining certain regulatory permits, approvals, and certificates.APS must comply in good faith with all applicable statutes, regulations, rules, tariffs, and orders of agencies that regulate APS’s business, including FERC, NRC, EPA, the ACC, and state and local governmental agencies. These agencies regulate many aspects of APS’s utility operations, including safety and performance, emissions, siting and construction of facilities, customer service and the rates that APS can charge retail and wholesale customers. Failure to comply can subject APS to, among other things, fines and penalties. For example, under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, FERC can impose penalties (approximately $1.2 million per day per violation) for failure to comply with mandatory electric reliability standards. APS is also required to have numerous permits, approvals and certificates from these agencies. APS believes the necessary permits, approvals and certificates have been obtained for its existing operations and that APS’s business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws in all material respects. Changes in laws or regulations that govern APS, new interpretations of law and regulations, or the imposition of new or revised laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on the manner in which we operate our business and our results of operations. In particular, new or revised laws or interpretations of existing laws or regulations may impact or call into question the ACC’s permissive regulatory authority, which may result in uncertainty as to jurisdictional authority within our state, and uncertainty as to whether ACC decisions will be binding or challenged by other agencies or bodies asserting jurisdiction. In November 2021, the Arizona Court of Appeals issued an opinion that called into question the ACC-approved limitation of liability provision found in the APS Service Schedules. APS sought review of the decision at the Arizona Supreme Court, which was denied; however, the Supreme Court depublished portions of the Court of Appeals’ decision. APS is seeking revised tariff language to mitigate potential adverse impacts on APS’s future, potential litigation exposure which may result from this court decision. We are unable to predict the impact on our business and operating results from any pending or future regulatory or legislative rulemaking.The operation of APS’s nuclear power plant exposes it to substantial regulatory oversight and potentially significant liabilities and capital expenditures.The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose safety-related, security-related and other licensing requirements for the operation of nuclear generating facilities. Events at nuclear facilities of other operators or impacting the industry generally may lead the NRC to impose additional requirements and regulations on all nuclear generating facilities, including Palo Verde. In the event of noncompliance with its requirements, the NRC has the authority to impose a progressively increased inspection regime that could ultimately result in the shut-down of a unit or civil penalties, or both, depending upon the NRC’s assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. The increased costs resulting from penalties, a heightened level of scrutiny and implementation of plans to achieve compliance with NRC requirements may adversely affect APS’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.APS is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations, and changes in, or liabilities under, existing or new laws or regulations may increase APS’s cost of operations or impact its business plans.APS is, or may become, subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of its present and future operations, including air emissions of conventional pollutants and GHGs, water quality, discharges of wastewater and waste streams originating from fly ash and bottom ash handling facilities, solid waste, hazardous waste, and coal combustion products, which consist of bottom ash, fly ash, and air pollution control wastes. These laws and regulations can result in increased capital, 35Table of Contents operating, and other costs, particularly with regard to enforcement efforts focused on power plant emissions obligations. These laws and regulations generally require APS to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, and other approvals. If there is a delay or failure to obtain any required environmental regulatory approval, or if APS fails to obtain, maintain, or comply with any such approval, operations at affected facilities could be suspended or subject to additional expenses. In addition, failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations could result in civil liability as a result of government enforcement actions or private claims or criminal penalties. Both public officials and private individuals may seek to enforce applicable environmental laws and regulations. APS cannot predict the outcome (financial or operational) of any related litigation that may arise.Environmental Clean Up. APS has been named as a PRP for a Superfund site in Phoenix, Arizona, and it could be named a PRP in the future for other environmental clean-up at sites identified by a regulatory body. APS cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating clean-up costs. There is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all PRPs.Coal Ash. In December 2014, EPA issued final regulations governing the handling and disposal of CCR, which are generated as a result of burning coal and consist of, among other things, fly ash and bottom ash. The rule regulates CCR as a non-hazardous waste. APS currently disposes of CCR in ash ponds and dry storage areas at Cholla and Four Corners. To the extent the rule requires the closure or modification of these CCR units, modification or changes to the manner of closure of such units, or the construction of new CCR units beyond what we currently anticipate, APS would incur significant additional costs for CCR disposal. In addition, the rule may also require corrective action to address releases from CCR disposal units or the presence of CCR constituents within groundwater near CCR disposal units above certain regulatory thresholds. Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards. In 2015, EPA finalized revisions to the NAAQS for ozone, which set new, more stringent standards on emissions of nitrogen oxide, a precursor to ozone, in an effort to protect human health and human welfare. Depending on the final attainment designations for the new standards and the state implementation requirements, APS may be required to invest in new pollution control technologies and to generate emission offsets for new projects or facility expansions located in ozone nonattainment areas. APS cannot assure that existing environmental regulations will not be revised or that new regulations seeking to protect the environment will not be adopted or become applicable to it. Revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, particularly if those costs incurred by APS are not fully recoverable from APS’s customers, could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Due to current or potential future regulations or legislation coupled with trends in natural gas and coal prices, or other clean energy rules or initiatives, the economics or feasibility of continuing to own certain resources, particularly coal facilities, may deteriorate, warranting early retirement of those plants, which may result in asset impairments. APS would seek recovery in rates for the book value of any remaining investments in the plants as well as other costs related to early retirement but cannot predict whether it would obtain such recovery.APS faces potential financial risks resulting from climate change litigation and legislative and regulatory efforts to limit GHG emissions, as well as physical and operational risks related to climate effects.Concern over climate change has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit CO2, which is a major byproduct of the combustion of fossil fuel, and other GHG emissions. 36Table of Contents Potential Financial Risks — Greenhouse Gas Regulation, the Clean Power Plan and Potential Litigation. In 2015, EPA finalized a rule to limit CO2 emissions from existing power plants, the Clean Power Plan, or CPP. The implementation of this rule within the jurisdictions where APS operates would have resulted in a shift in generation from coal to more natural gas and renewable generation. Because of a view that the federal Clean Air Act did not permit such an expansive use of administrative authority over utility generation resources, in 2019 regulations were issued that repealed the CPP and replaced it with a far narrower set of regulations focused solely on coal-fired power plant efficiency improvements. On January 19, 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated the ACE regulations and remanded them back to EPA to develop new regulations governing carbon emissions from existing power plants consistent with the court’s ruling. That decision, which endorsed an expansive view of the federal Clean Air Act consistent with the CPP, was subsequently reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court on June 30, 2022. While the current administration has expressed its intent to develop new carbon emission regulations governing existing power plants in 2023, such action will be constrained by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision that the CPP violated the Clean Air Act.Depending on the outcome of future carbon emission rulemakings under the Clean Air Act targeting new and existing power plants, the utility industry may become subject to more stringent and expansive regulations. Depending on the means of compliance with federal emission performance standards, the electric utility industry may be forced to incur substantial costs necessary to achieve compliance. In addition, we anticipate that such regulations will be challenged in federal court prior to their implementation. Depending on the outcome of such judicial review, the utility industry may face alternative efforts from private parties seeking to establish alternative GHG emission limitations from power plants. Alternative GHG emission limitations may arise from litigation under either federal or state common laws or citizen suit provisions of federal environmental statutes that attempt to force federal agency rulemaking or imposing direct facility emission limitations. Such lawsuits may also seek damages from harm alleged to have resulted from power plant GHG emissions.Physical and Operational Risks. Weather extremes such as drought and high temperature variations are common occurrences in the southwest United States’ desert area, and these are risks that APS considers in the normal course of business in the engineering and construction of its electric system. Large increases in ambient temperatures could require evaluation of certain materials used within its system and may represent a greater challenge. Limitations on water supplies necessary to operate electric generation infrastructure could arise from prolonged drought and shortage declarations associated with key surface water resources. As part of conducting its business, APS recognizes that the southwestern United States is particularly susceptible to the risks posed by climate change, which over time is projected to exacerbate high temperature extremes and prolong drought in the area where APS conducts its business.Co-owners of our jointly owned generation and transmission facilities may have unaligned goals and positions due to the effects of legislation, regulations, economic conditions, or changes in our industry, which could have a significant impact on our ability to continue operations of such facilities.APS owns certain of its power plants and transmission facilities jointly with other owners, with varying ownership interests in such facilities. Changes in the nature of our industry and the economic viability of certain plants and facilities, including impacts resulting from types and availability of other resources, fuel costs, legislation, and regulation, together with timing considerations related to expiration of leases or other agreements for such facilities, could result in unaligned positions among co-owners. Differences in the co-owners’ willingness or ability to continue their participation could lead to eventual shut down of units or facilities and uncertainty related to the resulting cost recovery of such assets. See Note 3 for a discussion of the Navajo Plant and Cholla retirement and the related risks associated with APS’s continued recovery of its remaining investment in the plant.37Table of Contents Deregulation or restructuring of the electric industry may result in increased competition, which could have a significant adverse impact on APS’s business and its results of operations.In 1999, the ACC approved rules for the introduction of retail electric competition in Arizona. Retail competition could have a significant adverse financial impact on APS due to an impairment of assets, a loss of retail customers, lower profit margins or increased costs of capital. Although some very limited retail competition existed in APS’s service area in 1999 and 2000, there are currently no active retail competitors offering unbundled energy or other utility services to APS’s customers. This is in large part due to a 2004 Arizona Court of Appeals decision that found critical components of the ACC’s rules to be violative of the Arizona Constitution. The ruling also voided the operating authority of all the competitive providers previously authorized by the ACC. On May 9, 2013, the ACC voted to re-examine the facilitation of a deregulated retail electric market in Arizona. The ACC subsequently opened a docket for this matter and received comments from a number of interested parties on the considerations involved in establishing retail electric deregulation in the state. One of these considerations is whether various aspects of a deregulated market, including setting utility rates on a “market” basis, would be consistent with the requirements of the Arizona Constitution. On September 11, 2013, after receiving legal advice from the ACC staff, the ACC voted 4-1 to close the current docket and await full Arizona Constitutional authority before any further examination of this matter. In November 2018, the ACC voted to re-examine the facilitation of a deregulated retail electric market in Arizona. On July 1 and July 2, 2019, ACC Staff issued a report and initial proposed draft rules regarding possible modifications to the ACC’s retail electric competition rules. On February 10, 2020, two ACC Commissioners filed two sets of draft proposed retail electric competition rules. On February 12, 2020, ACC Staff issued its second report regarding possible modifications to the ACC’s retail electric competition rules. During a July 15, 2020, ACC Staff meeting, the ACC Commissioners discussed the possible development of a retail competition pilot program, but no action was taken. The ACC continues to discuss matters related to retail electric competition, including the potential for additional buy-through programs or other pilot programs. In April 2022, the Arizona Legislature passed and the Governor signed a bill that repealed the electric deregulation law that had been in place in Arizona since 1998. OPERATIONAL RISKSAPS’s results of operations can be adversely affected by various factors impacting demand for electricity.Weather Conditions. Weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and affect the price of energy commodities. Electric power demand is generally a seasonal business. In Arizona, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time. As a result, APS’s overall operating results fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. In addition, APS has historically sold less power, and consequently earned less income, when weather conditions are milder. As a result, unusually mild weather could diminish APS’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.Apart from the impact upon electricity demand, weather conditions related to prolonged high temperatures or extreme heat events present operational challenges. In the southwestern United States, where APS conducts its business, the effects of climate change are projected to increase the overall average temperature, lead to more extreme temperature events, and exacerbate prolonged drought conditions leading to the declining availability of water resources. Extreme heat events and rising temperatures are projected to reduce the generation capacity of thermal-power plants and decrease the efficiency of the transmission grid. These operational risks related to rising temperatures and extreme heat events could affect APS’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 38Table of Contents Higher temperatures may decrease the snowpack, which might result in lowered soil moisture and an increased threat of forest fires. Forest fires could threaten APS’s communities and electric transmission lines and facilities. Any damage caused as a result of forest fires could negatively impact APS’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, the decrease in snowpack can also lead to reduced water supplies in the areas where APS relies upon non-renewable water resources to supply cooling and process water for electricity generation. Prolonged and extreme drought conditions can also affect APS’s long-term ability to access the water resources necessary for thermal electricity generation operations. Reductions in the availability of water for power plant cooling could negatively impact APS’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.Effects of Energy Conservation Measures and Distributed Energy Resources. APS customers in energy efficiency and conservation programs and other demand-side management efforts, which in turn impact the demand for electricity. APS must also meet certain distributed renewable energy requirements. A portion of APS’s total renewable energy requirement must be met with an increasing percentage of distributed renewable energy resources (generally, small scale renewable technologies located on customers’ properties). The distributed renewable energy requirement is 30% of the applicable RES requirement for 2012 and subsequent years (this requirement has been waived by the ACC for 2023). Customer participation in distributed renewable energy programs would result in lower demand since customers would be meeting some of their own energy needs.In addition to these rules and requirements, energy efficiency technologies and distributed energy resources continue to evolve, which may have similar impacts on demand for electricity. Reduced demand due to these energy efficiency requirements, distributed energy requirements and other emerging technologies, unless substantially offset through ratemaking mechanisms, could have a material adverse impact on APS’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Actual and Projected Customer and Sales Growth. Retail customers in APS’s service territory increased 2.1% for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared with the prior-year period. For the three years through 2022, APS’s customer growth averaged 2.2% per year. We currently project annual customer growth to be 1.5% to 2.5% for 2023 and the average annual growth to be in the range of 1.5% to 2.5% through 2025 based on anticipated steady population growth in Arizona during that period.Retail electricity sales in kWh, adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations, increased 2.4% for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared with the prior-year period. While steady customer growth was offset by energy savings driven by customer conservation, energy efficiency, and distributed renewable generation initiatives, the main drivers of positive sales for this period were a strong improvement in sales to commercial and industrial customers and the ramp-up of new data center customers.For the three years through 2022, annual retail electricity sales growth averaged 2.5%, adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations. Due to the expected rapid growth of several large data centers and new large manufacturing facilities, we currently project that annual retail electricity sales in kWh will increase in the range of 3.5% to 5.5% for 2023 and that average annual growth will be in the range of 4.5% to 6.5% through 2025, including the effects of customer conservation, energy efficiency, and distributed renewable generation initiatives, but excluding the effects of weather variations. This projected sales growth range includes the impacts of several large data centers and new large manufacturing facilities, which are expected to contribute to average annual growth in the range of 3.5% to 5.5% through 2025. Actual sales growth, excluding weather-related variations, may differ from our projections as a result of numerous factors, such as economic conditions, customer growth, usage patterns and energy conservation, slower ramp-up of and/or fewer data centers and large manufacturing facilities, slower than expected commercial and industrial expansions, impacts of energy efficiency programs, and growth in DG, 39Table of Contents and responses to retail price changes. Based on past experience, a 1% variation in our annual residential and small commercial and industrial kWh sales projections under normal business conditions can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of approximately $20 million, and a 1% variation in our annual large commercial and industrial kWh sales projections under normal business conditions can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of approximately $5 million.The operation of power generation facilities and transmission systems involves risks that could result in reduced output or unscheduled outages, which could materially affect APS’s results of operations.The operation of power generation, transmission and distribution facilities involves certain risks, including the risk of breakdown or failure of equipment, fuel interruption, and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency. Unscheduled outages, including extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other complications, occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of APS’s business. Because our transmission facilities are interconnected with those of third parties, the operation of our facilities could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the larger transmission power grid, and the operation or failure of our facilities could adversely affect the operations of others. Concerns over physical security of these assets could include damage to certain of our facilities due to vandalism or other deliberate acts that could lead to outages or other adverse effects. If APS’s facilities operate below expectations, especially during its peak seasons, it may lose revenue or incur additional expenses, including increased purchased power expenses. The impact of wildfires could negatively affect APS’s results of operations.Wildfires have the potential to affect the communities that APS serves and APS’s vast network of electric transmission and distribution lines and facilities. The potential likelihood of wildfires has increased due to many of the same weather and climate change impacts existing in Arizona as those that led to the catastrophic wildfires in California. While we proactively take steps to mitigate wildfire risk in the areas of our electrical assets, wildfire risk is always present due to APS’s expansive service territory. APS could be held liable for damages incurred as a result of wildfires if it was determined that they were caused by or enhanced due to APS’s negligence. Any damage caused to our assets, loss of service to our customers, or liability imposed as a result of wildfires could negatively impact APS’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. The inability to successfully develop, acquire or operate generation resources to meet future resource needs and load forecasts in accordance with reliability requirements and other new or evolving standards and regulations could adversely impact our business.Potential changes in regulatory standards, impacts of new and existing laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations, and the need to obtain various regulatory approvals create uncertainty surrounding our current and future generation portfolio. The current regulatory standards, laws, and regulations create strategic challenges as to the appropriate generation portfolio and fuel diversification mix. In addition, APS is required by the ACC to meet certain energy resource portfolio requirements, including those related to renewables development and energy efficiency measures, in addition to specific competitive resource procurement requirements. The development and operation of any generation facility is also subject to many risks, including those related to financing, siting, permitting, new and evolving technology, and the construction of sufficient transmission capacity to support these facilities. APS needs to develop or acquire new generation facilities, potentially modernize existing facilities, and/or contract for additional capacity in order to meet future resource needs and load forecasts. APS’s inability to do so could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.In expressing concerns about the environmental and climate-related impacts from continued extraction, transportation, delivery and combustion of fossil fuels, environmental advocacy groups and other third parties have in recent years undertaken greater efforts to oppose the permitting, construction, 40Table of Contents and operation of fossil fuel infrastructure projects. These efforts may increase in scope and frequency depending on a number of variables, including the future course of Federal environmental regulation and the increasing financial resources devoted to these opposition activities. APS cannot predict the effect that any such opposition may have on our ability to develop, construct, and operate fossil fuel infrastructure projects in the future. In January 2020, APS announced its goal to provide 100% clean, carbon-free electricity by 2050 with an intermediate 2030 target of achieving a resource mix that is 65% clean energy, with 45% of the generation portfolio coming from renewable energy. APS’s ability to successfully execute its clean energy commitment is dependent upon a number of external factors, some of which include supportive national and state energy policies, a supportive regulatory environment, sales and customer growth, the development, deployment and advancement of clean energy technologies, adequate supply chain for generation resources, and continued access to capital markets.The lack of access to sufficient supplies of water could have a material adverse impact on APS’s business and results of operations.Assured supplies of water are important for APS’s generating plants. Water in the southwestern United States is limited, and various parties have made conflicting claims regarding the right to access and use such limited supply of water. Both groundwater and surface water in areas important to the operation of APS’s generating plants have been and are the subject of inquiries, claims and legal proceedings. In addition, the region in which APS’s power plants are located suffer from prolonged drought conditions, which could potentially affect the plants’ water supplies. Climate change is also projected to exacerbate such drought conditions. In addition, Colorado River water supplies for Arizona are subject to a Tier 2a shortage declaration, which substantially limits the quantity of water available for the state. APS’s inability to access sufficient supplies of water, along with that of its customers, could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.We are subject to cybersecurity risks and risks of unauthorized access to our systems that could adversely affect our business and financial condition.We operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure. In the regular course of our business, we handle a range of sensitive security, customer, and business systems information. There appears to be an increasing level of activity, sophistication, and maturity of threat actors, including from both nation state and non-nation state actors, that seek to exploit potential vulnerabilities in the electric utility industry and wish to disrupt the U.S. bulk power system, our information technology systems, generation (including our Palo Verde nuclear facility), transmission and distribution facilities, and other infrastructure facilities and systems and physical assets. We have been and could be the target of attacks, and the aforementioned systems are critical areas of cyber protection for us. We rely extensively on IT systems, networks, and services, including internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities, and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms. Some of these systems are managed, hosted, provided, or used for third parties to assist in conducting our business. Malicious actors may attack vendors to disrupt the services these vendors provide to us or to use those vendors as a cyber conduit to attack us. As more third parties are involved in the operation of our business, there is a risk the confidentiality, integrity, privacy, or security of data held by, or accessible to, third parties may be compromised.If a significant cybersecurity event or breach were to occur, we may not be able to fulfill critical business functions and we could (i) experience property damage, disruptions to our business, theft of or unauthorized access to customer, employee, financial or system operation information or other information; (ii) experience loss of revenue or incur significant costs for repair, remediation and breach 41Table of Contents notification, and increased capital and operating costs to implement increased security measures; and (iii) be subject to increased regulation, litigation and reputational damage. If such disruptions or breaches are not detected quickly, their effects could be compounded or could delay our response or the effectiveness of our response and ability to limit our exposure to potential liability. These types of events would also require significant management attention and resources and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.We develop and maintain systems and processes aimed at detecting and preventing information and cybersecurity incidents which require significant investment, maintenance, and ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies and regulatory requirements change. These systems and processes may be insufficient to mitigate the possibility of cybersecurity incidents, malicious social engineering, fraudulent or other malicious activities, and human error or malfeasance in the safeguarding of our data.We are subject to laws and rules issued by multiple government agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining the confidentiality of our security, customer information and business information. One of these agencies, NERC, has issued comprehensive regulations and standards surrounding the security of bulk power systems, and is continually in the process of developing updated and additional requirements with which the utility industry must comply. The NRC also has issued regulations and standards related to the protection of critical digital assets at commercial nuclear power plants. The increasing promulgation of NERC and NRC rules and standards will increase our compliance costs and our exposure to the potential risk of violations of the standards. Experiencing a cybersecurity incident could cause us to be non-compliant with applicable laws and regulations, such as those promulgated by NERC and the NRC, privacy laws, or contracts that require us to securely maintain confidential data, causing us to incur costs related to legal claims or proceedings and regulatory fines or penalties.The risk of these system-related events and security breaches occurring continues to intensify. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, threats and attempted intrusions to our information technology systems and we could experience such threats and attempted intrusions to our operational control systems. To date, we do not believe we have experienced a material breach or disruption to our network or information systems or our service operations. We may not be able to anticipate and prevent all cyberattacks or information security breaches, and our ongoing investments in security resources, talent, and business practices may not be effective against all threat actors.We maintain cyber insurance to provide coverage for a portion of the losses and damages that may result from a security breach of our information technology systems, but such insurance is subject to a number of exclusions and may not cover the total loss or damage caused by a breach. Coverage for cybersecurity events continues to evolve as the industry matures. In the future, adequate insurance may not be available at rates that we believe are reasonable, and the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident may not be covered by insurance or recoverable in rates.The ownership and operation of power generation and transmission facilities on Indian lands could result in uncertainty related to continued leases, easements, and rights-of-way, which could have a significant impact on our business.Four Corners and portions of certain APS transmission lines are located on Indian lands pursuant to leases, easements or other rights-of-way that are effective for specified periods. APS is unable to predict the final outcomes of pending and future approvals by the applicable sovereign governing bodies with respect to renewals of these leases, easements, and rights-of-way.42Table of Contents There are inherent risks in the ownership and operation of nuclear facilities, such as environmental, health, fuel supply, spent fuel disposal, regulatory and financial risks and the risk of terrorist attack that could adversely affect our business and financial condition.APS has an ownership interest in and operates on behalf of a group of participants, Palo Verde, which is the largest nuclear electric generating facility in the United States. Palo Verde constitutes approximately 18% of APS’s owned and leased generation capacity. Palo Verde is subject to environmental, health and financial risks, such as the ability to obtain adequate supplies of nuclear fuel; the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel; the ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning; potential liabilities arising out of the operation of these facilities; the costs of securing the facilities against possible terrorist attacks; and unscheduled outages due to equipment and other problems. APS maintains nuclear decommissioning trust funds and external insurance coverage to minimize its financial exposure to some of these risks; however, it is possible that damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage. APS may be required under federal law to pay up to $120.1 million (but not more than $17.9 million per year) of liabilities arising out of a nuclear incident not only at Palo Verde, but at any other nuclear power plant in the United States. In addition, APS is subject to retrospective premium adjustments under its nuclear property insurance policies with Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (“NEIL”) for approximately $22.3 million if NEIL’s losses in any policy year exceed accumulated funds and if the retrospective premium assessment is declared by NEIL’s Board of Directors. Although APS has no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at Palo Verde, if an incident did occur, it could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit and to promulgate new regulations that could require significant capital expenditures and/or increase operating costs.Changes in technology could create challenges for APS’s existing business.Alternative energy technologies that produce power or reduce power consumption or emissions are being developed and commercialized, including renewable technologies such as photovoltaic (solar) cells, customer-sited generation, energy storage (batteries) and efficiency technologies. Advances in technology and equipment/appliance efficiency could reduce the demand for supply from conventional generation, including carbon-free nuclear generation, and increase the complexity of managing APS’s information technology and power system operations, which could adversely affect APS’s business.Customer-sited alternative energy technologies present challenges to APS’s operations due to misalignment with APS’s existing operational needs. When these resources lack “dispatchability” and other elements of utility-side control, they are considered “unmanaged” resources. The cumulative effect of such unmanaged resources results in added complexity for APS’s system management.APS continues to pursue and implement advanced grid technologies, including transmission and distribution system technologies and digital meters enabling two-way communications between the utility and its customers. Many of the products and processes resulting from these and other alternative technologies, including energy storage technologies, have not yet been widely used or tested on a long-term basis, and their use on large-scale systems is not as established or mature as APS’s existing technologies and equipment. The implementation of new and additional technologies adds complexity to our information technology and operational technology systems, which could require additional infrastructure and resources. Widespread installation and acceptance of new technologies could also enable the entry of new market participants, such as technology companies, into the interface between APS and its customers and could have other unpredictable effects on APS’s traditional business model.Deployment of renewable energy technologies is expected to continue across the western states and result in a larger portion of the overall energy production coming from these sources. These trends, which 43Table of Contents have benefited from historical and continuing government support for certain technologies, have the potential to put downward pressure on wholesale power prices throughout the western states which could make APS’s existing generating facilities less economical and impact their operational patterns and long-term viability. We are subject to employee workforce factors that could adversely affect our business and financial condition.Like many companies in the electric utility industry, our workforce is maturing, with approximately 30% of employees eligible to retire by the end of 2027. Although we have undertaken efforts to recruit, train and develop new employees, we face increased competition for talent. We are subject to other employee workforce factors, such as the availability and retention of qualified personnel and the need to negotiate collective bargaining agreements with union employees. These or other employee workforce factors could negatively impact our business, financial condition, or results of operations.COVID-19 could negatively affect our business. COVID-19 is a continually developing situation around the globe that has led to economic disruption and volatility in the financial markets. The spread of COVID-19 and efforts to contain the virus and mitigate its public health effects, could decrease demand for energy, lower economic growth, impact our employees and contractors, cause disruptions in our supply chain, increase certain costs, further increase volatility in the capital markets (and result in increases in the cost of capital or an inability to access the capital markets or draw on available credit facilities), delay the completion of capital or other construction projects and other operations and maintenance activities, delay payments or increase uncollectable accounts, impact our ability to hire or retain qualified employees, or cause other unpredictable events, each of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.FINANCIAL RISKSA downgrade of our credit ratings could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our current ratings are set forth in “Liquidity and Capital Resources — Credit Ratings” in Item 7. We cannot be sure that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. Any downgrade or withdrawal could adversely affect the market price of Pinnacle West’s and APS’s securities, limit our access to capital and increase our borrowing costs, which would adversely impact our financial results. We could be required to pay a higher interest rate for future financings, and our potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease. In addition, borrowing costs under our existing credit facilities depend on our credit ratings. A downgrade could also require us to provide additional support in the form of letters of credit or cash or other collateral to various counterparties. If our short-term ratings were to be lowered, it could severely limit access to the commercial paper market. We note that the ratings from rating agencies are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities and that each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.Investment performance, changing interest rates, new rules or regulations and other economic, social, and political factors could decrease the value of our benefit plan assets, nuclear decommissioning trust funds and other special use funds or increase the valuation of our related obligations, resulting in significant additional funding requirements. We are also subject to risks related to the provision of employee healthcare benefits and healthcare reform legislation. Any inability to fully recover these costs in our utility rates would negatively impact our financial condition.44Table of Contents We have significant pension plan and other postretirement benefits plan obligations to our employees and retirees, and legal obligations to fund our pension trust and nuclear decommissioning trusts for Palo Verde. We hold and invest substantial assets in these trusts that are designed to provide funds to pay for certain of these obligations as they arise. Declines in market values of the fixed income and equity securities held in these trusts may increase our funding requirements into the related trusts. Additionally, the valuation of liabilities related to our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans are impacted by a discount rate, which is the interest rate used to discount future pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. Declining interest rates decrease the discount rate, increase the valuation of the plan liabilities, and may result in increases in pension and other postretirement benefit costs, cash contributions, regulatory assets, and charges to OCI. Changes in demographics, including increased number of retirements or changes in life expectancy and changes in other actuarial assumptions, may also result in similar impacts. The minimum contributions required under these plans are impacted by federal legislation and related regulations. Increasing liabilities or otherwise increasing funding requirements under these plans, resulting from adverse changes in legislation or otherwise, could result in significant cash funding obligations that could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.We recover most of the pension and other postretirement benefit expense and all of the currently estimated nuclear decommissioning costs in our regulated rates. Any inability to fully recover these costs in a timely manner could have a material negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.Pending or future federal or state legislative or regulatory activity or court proceedings could increase costs of providing medical insurance for our employees and retirees. Any potential changes and resulting cost impacts cannot be determined with certainty at this time.Our cash flow depends on the performance of APS and its ability to make distributions.We derive essentially all of our revenues and earnings from our wholly-owned subsidiary, APS. Accordingly, our cash flow and our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of APS and its distributions to us. APS is a separate and distinct legal entity and has no obligation to make distributions to us.APS’s financing agreements may restrict its ability to pay dividends, make distributions or otherwise transfer funds to us. In addition, an ACC financing order requires APS to maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40% and does not allow APS to pay common dividends if the payment would reduce its common equity below that threshold. The common equity ratio, as defined in the ACC order, is total shareholder equity divided by the sum of total shareholder equity and long-term debt, including current maturities of long-term debt.Pinnacle West’s ability to meet its debt service obligations could be adversely affected because its debt securities are structurally subordinated to the debt securities and other obligations of its subsidiaries.Because Pinnacle West is structured as a holding company, all existing and future debt and other liabilities of its subsidiaries will be effectively senior in right of payment to its own debt securities. The assets and cash flows of our subsidiaries will be available, in the first instance, to service their own debt",49811,rf,20230227,2023,10K,real_textdata_2023
REAL_1075_01_mgmt_2023_0006,1075,01,1075:01,"Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations56 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSINTRODUCTION The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Financial Statements and APS’s Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes that appear in Item 8 of this report. This discussion provides a comparison of the 2022 results with 2021 results. A comparison of the 2021 results with 2020 results can be found in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. For information on factors that may cause our actual future results to differ from those we currently seek or anticipate, see “Forward-Looking Statements” at the front of this report and “Risk Factors” in Item 1A.OVERVIEW Business Overview Pinnacle West is an investor-owned electric utility holding company based in Phoenix, Arizona with consolidated assets of about $23 billion. For over 130 years, Pinnacle West and our affiliates have provided energy and energy-related products to people and businesses throughout Arizona. Pinnacle West derives essentially all of our revenues and earnings from our principal subsidiary, APS. APS is Arizona’s largest and longest-serving electric company that generates safe, affordable, and reliable electricity for approximately 1.3 million retail customers in 11 of Arizona’s 15 counties. APS is also the operator and co-owner of Palo Verde — a primary source of electricity for the southwest United States and the largest nuclear power plant in the United States.InflationOverall inflation has grown by 9.5% in Phoenix in 2022, compared to 6.5% nationally; however, APS’s work with national and international companies has helped to partially reduce local cost escalation impacts on APS. The impacts from inflation have varied across separate categories of APS’s spending. Pricing increases across major categories have ranged from 8% to 10% for vendor services and up to 15% to 60% for equipment in 2022. APS has seen specific inflationary impacts in individual spend categories, as well as general inflationary pricing impacts on a broader set of spend categories. Some of the highest increases in 2022 as compared to 2021 have been in chemical costs and contract services.Even prior to these increases, APS has focused on its customer affordability initiative, which has enabled APS to mitigate inflationary pressure. This initiative includes identifying efficiency opportunities through APS’s LEAN Sigma approach as well as other corporate decisions. For example, APS maintains its inventory to take advantage of lower pricing, when available, and to minimize supply chain delays that can increase the pricing due to expediting fees. Additionally, APS has proactively entered into long-term contracts to hedge against price volatility, which has allowed it to mitigate several procurement spend areas such as transformers.56Table of Contents Inflation Reduction Act of 2022On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”). The IRA significantly expands the availability of tax credits for investments in clean energy generation technologies and energy storage. Key provisions that are relevant to the Company’s clean energy commitment include (i) an extension of tax credits for solar and wind generation, including a new option for solar investments to claim a Production Tax Credit (“PTC”) in lieu of the Investment Tax Credit (“ITC”) beginning in 2022; (ii) expansion of the ITC to cover stand-alone energy storage technology beginning in 2023; and (iii) introduction of a new PTC for nuclear energy produced by existing nuclear energy plants, available from 2024 through 2032. The Internal Revenue Service and U.S. Treasury are expected to issue regulations and other guidance which will provide additional details and clarifications regarding how the Company may be able to claim each of these credits.In addition, the IRA contains several provisions which could create additional tax liabilities for corporations, including a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax for corporations with net profits in excess of $1 billion and a 1% excise tax on stock buybacks. We currently do not believe the Company will be subject to any material tax liabilities as a result of these legislative provisions.COVID-19COVID-19 continues to be an evolving situation. Essential planned work and capital investments continued during the pandemic with priority given to support fire mitigation and summer storm efforts, as well as heat-related outages. Raw material shortages, rising inflation, COVID-19 related work force disruptions and natural disasters continue to place increased pressure on the global supply chain. APS is experiencing some delays in finished materials and tight labor markets. To date, APS has not experienced labor or material supply chain shortages that have significantly impacted its ability to serve its customers’ needs. However, shortages are causing minor delays and shifting of work projects based on material availability. If APS continues to experience delays in materials, it could experience an increase in purchased power costs for summer generation needs. Such increased purchased power costs would be expected to be recoverable through the PSA. See Note 3 for additional information on the PSA. APS has measures in place to continually monitor and evaluate resource needs and supply chain adequacy but cannot predict whether there will be material supply chain shortages in the future.While the total expected impact of COVID-19 on future sales is currently unknown, APS experienced higher electric residential sales and lower electric commercial and industrial sales from the outset of the pandemic through April 2021. Beginning in May 2021, electric sales from commercial and industrial customers increased to levels in line with pre-COVID-19 sales but residential sales continued to be higher than pre-COVID-19 sales. Based on past experience, a 1% variation in our annual residential and small commercial and industrial kWh sales projections under normal business conditions can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of approximately $20 million, and a 1% variation in our annual large commercial and industrial kWh sales projections under normal business conditions can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of approximately $5 million.The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act allowed employers to defer payments of the employer share of Social Security payroll taxes that would have otherwise been owed from March 27, 2020, through December 31, 2020. We deferred the cash payment of the employer’s portion of Social Security payroll taxes for the period July 1, 2020, through December 31, 2020, which was approximately $18 million. As of December 31, 2022, we have paid this cash deferral in full.57Table of Contents Due to COVID-19, APS voluntarily suspended disconnections of customers for nonpayment beginning March 13, 2020 until December 31, 2020. The suspension of disconnection of customers for nonpayment ended on January 1, 2021, and customers were automatically placed on eight-month payment arrangements if they had past due balances at the end of the disconnection period of $75 or greater. APS voluntarily began waiving late payment fees of its customers on March 13, 2020. Effective February 1, 2023, late payment fees for residential customers were reinstated, and late payment fees for commercial and industrial customers were reinstated effective May 1, 2022. See Note 3 for additional information regarding the Summer Disconnection Moratorium.More detailed discussion of the impacts and future uncertainties related to COVID‐19 can be found throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Combined Notes to Pinnacle West’s and APS’s financial statements that appear in Part II, Item 8 of this report and “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.Strategic Overview Our strategy is to deliver shareholder value by creating a sustainable energy future for Arizona by serving our customers with clean, reliable, and affordable energy.Clean Energy CommitmentWe are committed to doing our part to make the future clean and carbon-free. As Arizona stewards, we do what is right for the people and prosperity of Arizona. Our vision is to create a sustainable energy future for Arizona through providing clean, affordable, and reliable energy. We can accomplish our visions through collaboration with customers, communities, employees, policymakers, shareholders, and other stakeholders. Our clean energy goal is based on sound science and supports continued growth and economic development while maintaining reliability and affordable prices for APS’s customers.APS’s clean energy goals consist of three parts: •a 2050 goal to provide 100% clean, carbon-free electricity;•a 2030 target of achieving a resource mix that is 65% clean energy, with 45% of the generation portfolio coming from renewable energy; and•a commitment to end APS’s use of coal-fired generation by 2031.APS’s ability to successfully execute its clean energy commitment is dependent upon a number of important external factors, some of which include a supportive regulatory environment, sales and customer growth, development of clean energy technologies and continued access to capital markets.2050 Goal: 100% Clean, Carbon-Free Electricity. Achieving a fully clean, carbon-free energy mix by 2050 is our aspiration. The 2050 goal will involve new thinking and depends on improved and new technologies.2030 Goal: 65% Clean Energy. APS has an energy mix that is already 50% clean with existing plans to add more renewables and energy storage before 2025. By building on those plans, APS intends to attain an energy mix that is 65% clean by 2030, with 45% of APS’s generation portfolio coming from renewable energy. “Clean” is measured as percent of energy mix which includes all carbon-free resources like nuclear, renewables, and demand-side management. “Renewable” energy includes generation sources such as solar, wind, and biomass, and is measured in accordance with the ACC’s Renewable Energy 58Table of Contents Standard as a percentage of retail sales. This target will serve as a checkpoint for our resource planning, investment strategy, and customer affordability efforts as APS moves toward 100% clean, carbon-free energy mix by 2050.2031 Goal: End APS’s Use of Coal-Fired Generation. The commitment to end APS’s use of coal-fired generation by 2031 will require APS to cease use of coal-generation at Four Corners. APS has permanently retired more than 1,000 MW of coal-fired electric generating capacity. These closures and other measures taken by APS have resulted in a total reduction of carbon emissions of 33% since 2005. In addition, APS has committed to end the use of coal at its remaining Cholla units by 2025.APS understands that the transition away from coal-fired power plants toward a clean energy future will pose unique economic challenges for the communities around these plants. We worked collaboratively with stakeholders and leaders of the Navajo Nation to consider the impacts of ceasing operation of APS coal-fired power plants on the communities surrounding those facilities to propose a comprehensive Coal Community Transition (“CCT”) plan. The proposed framework provided substantial financial and economic development support to build new economic opportunities and addresses a transition strategy for plant employees. We are committed to continuing our long-running partnership with the Navajo Nation in other areas as well, including expanding electrification and developing tribal renewable energy projects. Our proposed CCT plan supported the Navajo Nation, where Four Corners is located, the communities surrounding the Cholla Power Plant and the Hopi Tribe, which was impacted by closure of the Navajo Plant. On November 2, 2021, the ACC approved an amended 2019 Rate Case ROO that will require (i) equal payments over a three-year period that total $10 million to the Navajo Nation, (ii) a $1 million one-time payment to the Hopi Tribe within 60 days of the 2019 Rate Case decision, (iii) a $500,000 one-time payment to the Navajo County communities within 60 days of the 2019 Rate Case decision, (iv) up to $1.25 million for electrification of homes and businesses on the Hopi reservation, and (v) up to $1.25 million for the electrification of homes and businesses on the Navajo Nation reservation. The payments and expenditures are attributable to the future closures of Four Corners and Cholla, along with the prior closure of the Navajo Plant. All ordered payments and expenditures would be recoverable through rates. See Note 3 for a discussion of the CCT plan.Consistent with the 2019 Rate Case decision, as of April 2022, APS has completed the following payments that will be recoverable through rates related to the CCT: (i) $3.33 million to the Navajo Nation; (ii) $0.5 million to the Navajo County communities; and (iii) $1 million to the Hopi Tribe. Consistent with APS’s commitment to the impacted communities, APS has also completed the following payments: (i) $0.5 million to the Navajo Nation for CCT; (ii) $1.1 million to the Navajo County Communities for CCT and economic development; and (iii) $1.25 million to the Hopi Tribe for CCT and economic development. The ACC has also authorized $1.25 million to be recovered through rates for electrification of homes and businesses on both the Navajo Nation and Hopi reservation. Expenditure of the recoverable funds for electrification of homes and businesses on the Navajo Nation and the Hopi reservations is contingent upon completion of a census of the unelectrified homes and businesses in each that are also within APS service territory.On September 28, 2022, ACC Staff filed their staff report in the Matter of Impact of the Closures of Fossil-Based Generation Plan on Impacted Communities. APS and other interested parties filed comments on the report. On October 21, 2022, ACC Staff filed a revised report and proposed order. The revised report and proposed order recommended that funds for CCT shall not be collected from rate payers. On December 8, 2022, the ACC voted against ACC Staff’s proposed order. APS cannot predict if the ACC will take any further action on this matter.59Table of Contents In June 2021, APS and the owners of Four Corners entered into an agreement that would allow Four Corners to operate seasonally at the election of the owners beginning in fall 2023, subject to the necessary governmental approvals and conditions associated with changes in plant ownership. Under seasonal operation, one generating unit would be shut down during seasons where electricity demand is reduced, such as the winter and spring. The other unit would remain online year-round, subject to market conditions as well as planned maintenance outages and unplanned outages. APS anticipates that it will elect not to begin seasonal operation in November 2023, unless market conditions change.Renewables. APS’s IRP (see Note 3 for additional information) establishes the path to meeting our clean energy commitment and maintaining reliable electric service for our customers. APS intends to strengthen its already diverse energy mix by increasing its investments in carbon-free resources. Our IRP rapidly adds clean energy and storage resources while maintaining reliable and affordable service. Its near-term actions are focused on clean energy and positive customer outcomes and includes: (a) competitive solicitations to procure clean energy resources such as solar, wind, energy storage, and DSM resources, all of which lead to a cleaner grid; and (b) strategic, short-term wholesale market purchases from a combination of existing merchant natural gas units, neighboring utility systems, and wholesale market participants that ensure operational reliability.APS has a diverse portfolio of existing and planned renewable resources, including solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, and biogas that supports our commitment to clean energy, which is already strengthened by Palo Verde, the nation’s largest carbon-free, clean energy resource, that provides the foundation for reliable and affordable service for APS customers. APS’s longer-term clean energy strategy includes pursuing the right mix of purchased power contracts for new facilities, procurement of new facilities to be owned by APS, and the ongoing development of distributed energy resources. This balance will ensure an appropriately diverse portfolio designed to achieve the same operational reliability and customer affordability as APS’s near-term strategies. In addition, APS is actively seeking to include future facility purchase options in its PPAs that will enable investments with greater financial flexibility. APS uses competitive “All-Source” RFPs to pursue market resources that meet its system needs and offer the best value for customers. APS selects projects based on cost and commercial viability, taking into consideration timing and likelihood of successful contracting and development. Under current market conditions, APS must aggressively contract for resources that can withstand supply chain and other geopolitical pressures. Available projects are guided by IRP timelines and quantities and APS maintains a flexible approach that allows it to optimize system reliability and customer affordability through the RFP process. Agreements for the development and completion of future resources are subject to various conditions, including successful siting, permitting and interconnection of the projects to the electric grid. See “Business of Arizona Public Service Company — Energy Sources and Resource Planning — Current and Future Resources — Renewable Energy Standard — Renewable Energy Portfolio” in Item 1 for details regarding APS’s renewable energy resources.In September 2019, APS issued an RFP that requested up to 250 MW of wind resources to be in service as soon as possible, but no later than 2022. As a result of this RFP, APS executed a 200 MW PPA for a wind resource that went into service in January 2022. In December 2020, APS issued two additional RFPs: (i) a battery storage RFP for projects to be located at two AZ Sun sites; and (ii) an all source RFP that solicited resources to meet our clean energy needs and capacity to maintain system reliability, and that was later amended to include a request for 150 MW of solar resources to be developed on APS property and owned by APS. As a result of the December 2020 RFPs, APS executed two solar plus storage PPAs totaling 275 combined MW, a PPA for a 238 MW wind resource, two energy storage PPAs for a combined 300 MW, extended an existing natural gas tolling agreement and also executed an engineering, 60Table of Contents procurement, and construction contract in November 2021 for a 150 MW solar resource to be owned by APS and in service in early 2023.In May 2022, APS issued an RFP to address resource needs for 2025 and beyond. The 2022 RFP solicits competitive proposals for approximately 1,000 MW to 1,500 MW of resources, including up to 600 MW to 800 MW of renewable resources to meet the needs of 2025 and 2026 while considering resources that can be online as late as 2027. The 2022 RFP stopped accepting bids on July 15, 2022, and APS sent notifications to shortlisted bidders on September 23, 2022. As a result of the 2022 RFP, and as of December 31, 2022, APS has signed a PPA for 300 MW of solar plus energy storage resources and a PPA for 216 MW of wind resources. Once it secures those important resources and closes out the 2022 RFP, APS intends to issue its next RFP to address future resource needs.Energy Storage. APS deploys a number of advanced technologies on its system, including energy storage. Energy storage provides capacity, improves power quality, can be utilized for system regulation and, in certain circumstances, be used to defer certain traditional infrastructure investments. Energy storage also aids in integrating renewable generation by storing excess energy when system demand is low and renewable production is high and then releasing the stored energy during peak demand hours later in the day and after sunset. APS is utilizing grid-scale energy storage projects to meet customer reliability requirements, increase renewable utilization, and further our understanding of how storage works with other advanced technologies and the grid. In 2018, APS issued RFP for approximately 106 MW of energy storage to be located at up to five of its AZ Sun sites. Based upon its evaluation of the RFP responses, APS decided to expand the initial phase of battery deployment to 141 MW by adding a sixth AZ Sun site. These battery storage facilities are currently expected to be in service during the first quarter of 2023. On August 2, 2021, APS executed a contract for an additional 60 MW of utility-owned energy storage to be located on APS’s AZ Sun sites. This contract, with a 2023 in-service date, will complete the addition of storage on current APS-owned utility-scale solar facilities.Additionally, in February 2019, APS signed two 20-year PPAs for energy storage totaling 150 MW. These PPAs were subject to ACC approval in order to allow for cost recovery through the PSA. APS received the requested ACC approval on January 12, 2021, and service under the agreements is expected to begin in 2023. As a result of its December 2020 RFPs, APS executed four 20-year PPAs for resources that include energy storage: (a) two PPAs for standalone energy storage resources totaling 300 MW; and (b) two PPAs for solar plus energy storage resources totaling 275 MW. The PPAs are also subject to ACC approval to enable cost recovery through the PSA. APS received the requested ACC approval for three out of four of the projects on December 16, 2021 and on April 13, 2022 for the remaining project. Service under the agreements is expected to begin in 2023 and 2024.Following the 2022 RFP, as of January 2023, APS has executed a 20-year PPA for solar plus storage resources totaling 300 MW. The PPA is subject to ACC approval to enable cost recovery through the PSA, which was requested in December 2022 and approved in February 2023. Service under this agreement is expected to begin in 2025.APS currently plans to install more than 1,200 MW of energy storage by 2025, including the energy storage projects under PPAs and AZ Sun retrofits described above. The remaining energy storage is expected to be made up of resources solicited through current and future RFPs. 61Table of Contents The following table summarizes the resources in APS’s energy storage portfolio that are in operation and under development as of December 31, 2021.

Palo Verde, the nation’s largest carbon-free, clean energy resource, will continue to be a foundational part of APS’s resource portfolio. Palo Verde is not just the cornerstone of our current clean energy mix; it also is a significant provider of clean energy to the southwest United States. The plant is a critical asset to the Southwest, generating more than 32 million MWh annually – enough power for roughly 3.4 million households, or approximately 8.5 million people. Its continued operation is important to a carbon-free and clean energy future for Arizona and the region, as a reliable, continuous, affordable resource and as a large contributor to the local economy. AffordableBuilding upon existing cost management efforts, APS launched a customer affordability initiative in 2019. The initiative was implemented company-wide to thoughtfully and deliberately assess our business processes and organizational approaches to completing high-value work and achieving internal efficiencies. APS continues to drive this initiative by identifying opportunities to streamline its business processes to assist in mitigating cost increases, increasing employee retention, and improving customer satisfaction. Participation in the EIM continues to be a tool for creating savings for APS’s customers from the real-time, voluntary market. APS continues to expect that its participation in EIM will lower its fuel and purchased-power costs, improve situational awareness for system operations in the Western Interconnection power grid, and improve integration of APS’s renewable resources. APS continues to evaluate opportunities that benefit our customers and is exploring opportunities to move to a day-ahead market with the expectation of reliably achieving incrementally greater cost savings and using the region’s increasing renewable resources more efficiently. As part of that effort, APS is exploring several options. APS is in discussions with the current EIM operator, the CAISO, the Western Resource Adequacy Program, the Western Markets Exploratory Group, and the Southwest Power Pool. Each of these explorations also involve other entities and are being undertaken to evaluate the feasibility and cost/benefit of creating a voluntary day-ahead market.ReliableWhile our energy mix evolves, the obligation to deliver reliable service to our customers remains. APS is managing through significant growth in the Phoenix metropolitan area while experiencing supply chain issues similar to other industries.62Table of Contents Planned investments will support operating and maintaining the grid, updating technology, accommodating customer growth, and enabling more renewable energy resources. Our advanced distribution management system allows operators to locate outages, control line devices remotely and helps them coordinate more closely with field crews to safely maintain an increasingly dynamic grid. The system also integrates a new meter data management system that increases grid visibility and gives customers access to more of their energy usage data.Wildfire safety remains a critical focus for APS and other utilities. We increased investment in fire mitigation efforts to clear defensible space around our infrastructure, continue ongoing system upgrades, build partnerships with government entities and first responders and educate customers and communities. These programs contribute to customer reliability, responsible forest management and safe communities.The new units at our modernized Ocotillo Power Plant provide cleaner-running and more efficient units. They support reliability by responding quickly to the variability of solar generation and delivering energy in the late afternoon and early evening when solar production declines as the sun sets and customer demand peaks. APS continues to evaluate options to meet growing energy demand and ensure grid reliability, including through upgrades to and/or modernization of additional existing gas facilities.In October of 2021, APS announced plans to evaluate regional market solutions as part of the informal Western Markets Exploratory Group (“WMEG”). As part of WMEG, APS is exploring the potential for a staged approach to new market services, including day-ahead energy sales, transmission system expansion, and other power supply and grid solutions consistent with existing state regulations. WMEG hopes to identify market solutions that can help achieve carbon reduction goals while supporting reliable, affordable service for customers. APS is unable to predict the outcome of these discussions.APS’s key elements to delivering reliable power include resource planning, sufficient reserve margins, customer partnerships to manage peak demand, fire mitigation, and operational preparedness. Seasonal readiness procedures at APS also include walkdowns to ensure good material conditions and critical control system surveys. APS also plans for the unexpected by conducting emergency operations drills and coordinating on fire and emergency management with federal, state, and local agencies.Customer-FocusedRecognizing that creating customer value is inextricably linked to increasing shareholder value, APS’s focus remains on its customers and the communities it serves. Accordingly, it is APS’s goal to achieve an industry-leading, best-in-class customer experience, while demonstrating compassion and advocacy for its customers. This multi-year objective includes incrementally improving APS’s J.D. Power (“JDP”) overall customer satisfaction ratings from the fourth quartile to the first quartile of its peer set comprised of large investor-owned utilities. APS made progress on that front in 2022.As previously disclosed, APS’s JDP Residential rankings for overall customer satisfaction rating improved in 2020 and 2021. That improvement trend continued with the JDP Residential 2022 year-end results. Compared to 2021, APS made quartile gains in every single driver of residential customer satisfaction, firmly lifting APS into the second quartile nationally. Consequently, overall residential satisfaction is now above industry benchmarks when compared to APS’s large investor-owned peers. APS’s strongest performing drivers for the year were Customer Care (phone and digital), Power Quality and Reliability, Corporate Citizenship, and Billing & Payment. Additionally, the JDP Business 2022 full-year results place APS in the top – or first – quartile of utilities nationally for business customers. As a 63Table of Contents result, APS is among the most improved utilities in the nation for both residential and business customer satisfaction.In mid-2021, APS initiated an organization-wide customer experience strategy council designed to further drive a customer-oriented culture and improve customer satisfaction. Through this and other on-going customer-centric initiatives, APS has embraced increased empathy training for care center associates and adopted more flexible payment arrangements for customers. Numerous customer web-based enhancements also were implemented, including streamlined navigation and Spanish language transaction capabilities on aps.com; an enhanced online power outage center; and enrollment of more than 1 million customers for outage email and text notifications. Additionally, APS launched a broad-reaching multi-channel communications campaign focused on messages that matter most to APS’s customers – reliability, energy-efficiency, financial assistance, the environment, and programs that enable customers to design their own personalized energy experience.APS offers assistance programs that provide discounts to qualified limited-income customers, as well as programs to help customers stay current on their bills. And, to ensure our most vulnerable customers are connected to these programs, we train and work with more than 100 community action agencies. APS’s Energy Support program gives qualified limited-income customers a 25% discount on their bill each month. Additionally, qualified customers experiencing an unplanned major expense or an unexpected reduction in income can receive up to $800 a year to cover current or past due APS bills through the Crisis Bill Assistance program. Making customers aware of the assistance programs and resources available to them is a top priority for APS, and we have significantly increased the level of marketing and customer outreach through various campaigns and communication channels. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 60,000 customers received an aggregate of about $29.6 million in bill assistance from various sources, with the largest amount coming from the Arizona Department of Economic Security’s Emergency Rental Assistance Program. This assistance is on top of the approximately $33 million of discounts provided to eligible customers through the APS Energy Support Program. A consumer working group and a customer advisory board were formed in 2020 – the former made up of stakeholders and advocates representing various customer interests, and the latter comprised of a cross-section of customers. APS meets monthly with the consumer working group to obtain feedback on customer-related initiatives. Topics in 2022 ranged from TOU implementation, bill redesign, aps.com, customer assistance and customer care center performance. APS also met with the customer advisory board in 2022 to keep apprised of customer needs, wants and perspectives on a variety of topics, including rate plan selection, billing and payment alerts, value for price insights and outage experience. The customer advisory board’s input helped shape customer communications, as well as our thinking on related program development. In September 2022, APS completed the transition to new 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. on-peak TOU hours. More than one million residential customer meters were reprogrammed to the new on-peak hours. Developing Clean Energy Technologies Electric Vehicles APS is making electric vehicle charging more accessible for its customers and helping Arizona businesses, schools and governments electrify their fleets. In 2021, APS continued its expansion of its Take Charge AZ Pilot Program. As of December 31, 2022, APS had installed 668 Level 2 (“L2”) charging ports at customer locations, with more stations expected to be added through 2023. The program provides 64Table of Contents charging equipment, installation, and maintenance to business customers, government agencies, non-profits, and multifamily housing communities. In addition to the L2 charging stations, APS has deployed DC fast charging (“DCFC”) stations that are owned and operated by APS at five locations in Arizona. The first location opened for public use in March 2022 in Show Low, Arizona. The other four projects in Sedona, Prescott, Globe, and Payson were energized by the end of 2022. Each location features 2-150 kilowatt and 2-350 kilowatt DCFC ports. Charging at these stations will be accessible through the Electrify America charging network. APS has a goal to reach 450,000 light-duty electric vehicles in its service territory by 2030.Additionally, as part of APS’s DSM Plan, APS has launched an Electric Vehicle Charging Demand Management Pilot Program to proactively address the growing electric demand from electric vehicle charging as electric vehicles become more widely adopted. This program includes the APS SmartCharge data gathering program, a $250 residential electric vehicle smart charger rebate for qualifying electric vehicle chargers, Fleet Advisory Services, and a $100 rebate to home builders for new homes to be built EV ready with 240V charging station garage outlets. APS filed its 2023 DSM Plan on November 30, 2022, which proposes two new programs, an expanded residential EV Managed Charging Program and a Commercial Make-Ready Program. The Commercial Make-Ready Program is intended to help reduce some of the high upfront cost for our customers installing DCFC stations, and enables APS to deploy effective load management strategies at these commercial sites. The ACC ordered certain public service corporations, including APS, to develop a long-term, comprehensive statewide transportation electrification plan (“TE Plan”) for Arizona. The statewide TE Plan is intended to provide a roadmap for transportation electrification in Arizona, focused on realizing the associated air quality and economic development benefits for all residents in the state along with understanding the impact of electric vehicle charging on the grid. APS actively participated in the development of that plan, which was approved by the ACC in December 2021. In the decision, the ACC also ordered APS and another large Arizona electric public service corporation to each develop and submit for ACC approval their own TE Plans and corresponding budget for 2023. Accordingly, APS met its compliance obligation and filed both a 2023 TE Plan on June 1, 2022 and a supplemental TE Plan on November 30, 2022. APS will file its required TE progress reports on March 15 and September 15, 2023, along with a 2024 TE Plan later this year. Hydrogen Production APS, in partnership with Idaho National Laboratory (“INL”), Energy Harbor Corporation (“Energy Harbor”), and Xcel Energy Incorporated (“Xcel”), was chosen by the DOE’s Office of Nuclear Energy to participate in a series of hydrogen production projects with the goal to improve the long-term economic competitiveness of the nuclear power industry. The multi-phase projects began in 2020 with a series of small-scale hydrogen production demonstration projects led by Energy Harbor and Xcel, as well as a technical and economic assessment performed by INL of using electricity generated at Palo Verde to produce hydrogen. Based on the experience from Palo Verde’s utility partners’ small scale demonstration projects and from the Palo Verde-specific technical and economic assessment performed by INL, in April 2021, PNW Hydrogen LLC (“PNW Hydrogen”), a newly formed subsidiary of Pinnacle West, applied for DOE funding for a larger scale hydrogen production demonstration project using electricity sourced from Palo Verde. On October 7, 2021, PNW Hydrogen was notified that DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy and Office of Nuclear Energy had selected PNW Hydrogen’s application for an award of $20 million in federal funding to support the hydrogen production demonstration project, subject to 65Table of Contents negotiation and execution of a definitive Cooperative Agreement funding instrument between PNW Hydrogen and DOE. PNW Hydrogen continues to work through negotiations with DOE, while also investigating how best to coordinate its efforts with the Southwest Clean Hydrogen Innovation Network (“SHINe”) regional hub on development opportunities.SHINe Regional Hub. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (“IIJA”), also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, was signed into law on November 15, 2021. Among other things, the IIJA included money for regional clean hydrogen hubs, and on February 15, 2022, the Department of Energy DOE announced a Request for Information to collect feedback from stakeholders to inform the implementation and design of the regional hubs. On May 12, 2022, APS, along with three other Arizona energy providers and the State’s three public universities announced the formation of a new, interdisciplinary coalition, called the Arizona Center for a Carbon Neutral Economy (“AzCaNE”), with the goal of attaining a carbon neutral economy in Arizona. AzCaNE’s first action was to pursue the creation of an Arizona-led approach to securing regional clean hydrogen hub funding. Leading professionals from the seven founding participants, along with representatives of Arizona, the Navajo Nation and companies working to develop a hydrogen ecosystem within Arizona make up the Governance Committee for AzCaNE’s current efforts.On September 22, 2022, the DOE opened applications for the up to $7 billion program to create six to ten regional clean hydrogen hubs across the country. Concept papers for each regional hub were due by November 7, 2022, and AzCaNE submitted a concept paper for the SHINe regional hub. On December 27, 2022, the SHINe regional hub was one of thirty-three regional hubs encouraged to submit a full application by the DOE. Full applications are due by April 7, 2023.Carbon CaptureCarbon capture technologies can isolate CO2 and either sequester it permanently in geologic formations or convert it for use in products. Currently, almost all existing fossil fuel generators do not control carbon emissions the way they control emissions of other air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide or oxides of nitrogen. Carbon capture technologies are still in the demonstration phase and while they show promise, they are still being tested in real-world conditions. These technologies could offer the potential to keep in operation existing generators that otherwise would need to be retired. APS will continue to monitor this emerging technology.Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) PracticesPinnacle West has been integrating ESG practices into its core work for almost 30 years. As a business strategy, we seek solutions that provide “shared value,” meaning solutions that address societal and environmental challenges in a way that also delivers business value. Our commitment extends beyond implementing sustainability practices; we are dedicated to working with our stakeholders to identify and address the sustainability issues that we are uniquely positioned to impact through our business. In 2020, in support of our clean energy commitment and the growing focus on ESG within our organization, we increased our efforts by dedicating a new Sustainability Department at Pinnacle West to integrating ESG best practices into the everyday work of the Company. As a first step, the Company engaged the Electric Power Research Institute (“EPRI”) and leveraged input from employees, large customers, limited-income advocates, economic development groups, environmental non-governmental organizations, leading sustainability academics and other stakeholders to 66Table of Contents identify and assess the sustainability issues that matter most. In total, 23 Priority Sustainability Issues (“PSIs”) were identified and prioritized. The most critical category, Integral Shared Value, includes four issues deemed most important and most able to be impacted by our actions: clean energy, customer experience, energy access and reliability and safety and health. These Integral PSIs provide the foundation for informing our strategic direction, creating a framework for incorporating best practices and driving enterprise-wide alignment and accountability. In 2021, the Company engaged EPRI for the second phase of this work, focused on benchmarking best practices within these four Integral Shared Value PSIs. We utilized the benchmarking information to identify opportunities for further improvement in our ESG performance. In 2021, the Company established a Social Issues Committee Framework. The goal of the framework is to provide a process for considering emergent social issues, and for determining whether or how best to engage. The committee’s responsibility is to determine, using a set of principles grounded in the APS Promise and the PSIs, whether engagement on specific emergent social issues is appropriate and, if so, how best to engage. The Company also finalized an ESG Strategic Framework to guide our work. The framework is based upon three foundational pillars: ESG Policy Advocacy (we advocate for policy that supports our clean energy goals); Driving Performance (improving our ESG performance in the most important areas, including our PSIs); and effectively communicating and amplifying our ESG story to our various stakeholders, including investors, customers, employees and beyond. Throughout 2022, the ESG Strategic Framework has guided our ESG activities allowing the Sustainability Department to prioritize projects and collaborate with our teams in the Company. Also in 2022, the Company developed an ESG Narrative, aligned to the APS Promise, to guide the Company’s communications strategy internally and externally to customers to effectively share APS’s sustainability story.Regulatory Overview2022 Retail Rate CaseAPS filed an application with the ACC on October 28, 2022 (the “2022 Rate Case”) seeking an increase in annual retail base rates on the date rates become effective (“Day 1”) of a net $460 million. This Day 1 net impact represents a total base revenue deficiency of $772 million offset by proposed adjustor transfers of cost recovery to annual retail rates and adjustor mechanism modifications. The average annual customer bill impact of APS’s request on Day 1 is an increase of 13.6%.The principal provisions of APS’s application are:•a test year comprised of 12 months ended June 30, 2022, adjusted as described below;•an original cost rate base of $10.5 billion, which approximates the ACC-jurisdictional portion of the book value of utility assets, net of accumulated depreciation and other credits;•the following proposed capital structure and costs of capital: Capital Structure Cost of Capital Long-term debt 48.07 %3.85%Common stock equity 51.93 %10.25 %Weighted-average cost of capital 7.17 % 67Table of Contents •a 1% return on the increment of fair value rate base above APS’s original cost rate base, as provided for by Arizona law;•a rate of $0.038321 per kWh for the portion of APS’s retail base rates attributable to fuel and purchased power costs;•modification of its adjustment mechanisms including:▪eliminate the Environmental Improvement Surcharge and collect costs through base rates,▪eliminate the Lost Fixed Cost Recovery mechanism and collect costs through base rates and the Demand Side Management Adjustment Charge (“DSMAC”),▪maintain as inactive the Tax Expense Adjustor Mechanism,▪maintain the Transmission Cost Adjustment mechanism,▪modify the performance incentive in the DSMAC, and▪modify the Renewable Energy Adjustment Charge to include recovery of capital carrying costs of APS owned renewable and storage resources;•changes to its limited-income program, including a second tier to provide an additional discount for customers with greater need; and•twelve months of post-test year plant to reflect used and useful projects that will be placed into service prior to July 1, 2023.APS requested that the increase become effective December 1, 2023. The hearing for this rate case is currently scheduled to begin in August 2023. APS cannot predict the outcome of its request.2019 Retail Rate CaseOn October 31, 2019, APS filed an application with the ACC (the “2019 Rate Case”) seeking an increase in annual retail base rates. On August 2, 2021, the Administrative Law Judge issued a Recommended Opinion and Order in the 2019 Rate Case (the “2019 Rate Case ROO”) and issued corrections on September 10 and September 20, 2021. See Note 3 for information regarding the 2019 Rate Case ROO.On October 6, 2021 and October 27, 2021, the ACC voted on various amendments to the 2019 Rate Case ROO that would result in, among other things, (i) a return on equity of 8.70%, (ii) the recovery of the deferral and rate base effects of the operating costs and construction of the Four Corners SCR project, with the exception of $215.5 million (see “Four Corners SCR Cost Recovery” below), (iii) that the CCT plan include the following components: (a) a payment of $1 million to the Hopi Tribe within 60 days of the 2019 Rate Case decision, (b) a payment of $10 million over three years to the Navajo Nation, (c) a payment of $0.5 million to the Navajo County communities within 60 days of the 2019 Rate Case decision, (d) up to $1.25 million for electrification of homes and businesses on the Hopi reservation, and (e) up to $1.25 million for the electrification of homes and businesses on the Navajo Nation reservation. These payments and expenditures are attributable to the future closures of Four Corners and Cholla, along with the prior closure of the Navajo Plant and all ordered payments and expenditures would be recoverable through rates, and (iv) a change in the residential on-peak time-of-use period from 3 p.m. to 8 p.m. to 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Friday, excluding holidays. The 2019 Rate Case ROO, as amended, results in a total annual revenue decrease for APS of $4.8 million, excluding temporary CCT payments and expenditures. On November 2, 2021, the ACC approved the 2019 Rate Case ROO, as amended. On November 24, 2021, APS filed an application for rehearing of the 2019 Rate Case with the ACC and the application was deemed denied on December 15, 2021, as the ACC did not act upon it. On December 17, 2021, APS filed its Notice of Direct Appeal at the Arizona Court of Appeals and a Petition for Special Action with the Arizona Supreme Court, requesting review of the disallowance of $215.5 million of Four 68Table of Contents Corners SCR plant investments and deferrals (see “Four Corners SCR Cost Recovery” below for additional information) and the 20 basis point penalty reduction to the return on equity. On February 8, 2022, the Arizona Supreme Court declined to accept jurisdiction on APS’s Petition for Special Action. The Arizona Court of Appeals heard oral arguments on November 30, 2022. The Court took the matter under advisement and will issue its decision in due course. APS cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding.Consistent with the 2019 Rate Case decision, APS implemented the new rates effective as of December 1, 2021. In addition, the ACC ordered extensive compliance and reporting obligations and will be continuing to explore whether penalties or rebates would be owed to certain customers. APS completed the implementation of the new on-peak hours for residential customers before the September 1, 2022 deadline. APS cannot predict if the ACC will take any further action on this matter. Additionally, consistent with the 2019 Rate Case decision, as of April 2022, APS has completed the following payments that will be recoverable through rates related to the CCT: (i) $3.33 million to the Navajo Nation; (ii) $0.5 million to the Navajo County communities; and (iii) $1 million to the Hopi Tribe. Consistent with APS’s commitment to the impacted communities, APS ha",49778,mgmt,20230227,2023,10K,real_textdata_2023
REAL_1050_01_rf_2023_0007,1050,01,1050:01,"Item 1A. Risk Factors 11 Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and include, but are not limited to: •the sensitivity of our business to economic and financial market conditions generally and economic conditions in CECO’s service areas; •dependence on fixed price contracts and the risks associated therewith, including actual costs exceeding estimates and method of accounting for revenue; •the effect of growth on CECO’s infrastructure, resources and existing sales; •the ability to expand operations in both new and existing markets; •the potential for contract delay or cancellation as a result of on-going or worsening supply chain challenges; •liabilities arising from faulty services or products that could result in significant professional or product liability, warranty or other claims; •changes in or developments with respect to any litigation or investigation; •failure to meet timely completion or performance standards that could result in higher cost and reduced profits or, in some cases, losses on projects; •the potential for fluctuations in prices for manufactured components and raw materials, including as a result of tariffs and surcharges; •the substantial amount of debt incurred in connection with our strategic transactions and our ability to repay or refinance it or incur additional debt in the future; •the impact of federal, state or local government regulations; •our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock and the amounts and timing of repurchases, if any; •economic and political conditions generally; •our ability to successfully realize the expected benefits of our restructuring program; •our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and realize the synergies from strategic transactions; and •unpredictability and severity of catastrophic events, including cybersecurity threats, acts of terrorism or outbreak of war or hostilities or public health crises, as well as management’s response to any of the aforementioned factors. Many of these risks are beyond management’s ability to control or predict. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any related assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material aspects from those currently anticipated. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements as they speak only to our views as of the date the statement is made. Furthermore, the forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. Except as required under the federal securities laws or the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), we undertake no obligation to update or review any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors An investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risk factors described below, together with the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before you decide to invest in our securities. The risks described below are the material risks of which we are currently aware; however, they may not be the only risks that we may face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently view as immaterial may also impair our business. Although the risks are organized by headings, and each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated. If any of these risks develop into actual events, it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and the trading price of your shares could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment. Risks Related to Our Business and Industry Our business may be adversely affected by global economic conditions. A national or global economic downturn or credit crisis may have a significant negative impact on our financial condition, future results of operations and cash flows. Specific risk factors related to these overall economic and credit conditions include the following: •customers or potential customers may reduce or delay their procurement or new product development; •key suppliers may have difficulties resulting in delays for our material purchases; •vendors, suppliers and other third parties may fail to perform their contractual obligations; and •customers may become insolvent and/or unable to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products and services. These risk factors could reduce our product sales, increase our operating costs, impact our ability to collect customer receivables, lengthen our cash conversion cycle and increase our need for cash, which would ultimately decrease our profitability and negatively impact our financial condition. They could also limit our ability to expand through acquisitions due to the tightening of the credit markets. Our dependence upon fixed-price contracts could adversely affect our operating results. The majority of our projects are currently performed on a fixed-price basis, while a limited number of projects are currently performed on a time and materials basis. Under a fixed-price contract, we agree on the price that we will receive for the entire project, based upon a defined scope, which includes specific assumptions and project criteria. If our estimates of the costs to complete the project are below the actual costs that we incur, our margins will decrease, or we may incur a loss. The revenue, cost and gross profit realized on a fixed-price contract will often vary from the estimated amounts because of unforeseen conditions or changes in job conditions and variations in labor and equipment productivity over the term of the contract. While our fixed-price contracts are typically not individually material to our operating results, if we are unsuccessful in mitigating these risks, we may realize gross profits that are different from those originally estimated and incur reduced profitability or losses on projects. Depending on the size of a project, these variations from estimated contract performance could have a significant effect on our operating results. In general, turnkey contracts to be performed on a fixed-price basis involve an increased risk of significant variations. Generally, our contracts and projects vary in length, depending on the size and complexity of the project, project owner demands and other factors. The foregoing risks are exacerbated for projects with longer-term durations and the inherent difficulties in estimating costs and of the interrelationship of the integrated services to be provided under these contracts whereby unanticipated costs or delays in performing part of the contract can have compounding effects by increasing costs of performing other parts of the contract. Accounting for contract revenue may result in material adjustments that would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from fixed price contracts. We recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and services. A significant amount of our revenue is recognized over a period of time as we perform under the contract because control of the work in process transfers continuously to the customer. For performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. Progress is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs to complete the performance obligation. For these contracts, the cost-to-cost measure best depicts the continuous transfer of goods or services to the customer. Contract revenue and total direct cost estimates are reviewed and revised periodically as the work progresses and as change orders are approved, and adjustments are reflected in contract revenue in the period when these estimates are revised. These estimates are based 11 on management’s reasonable assumptions and our historical experience, and are only estimates. Variation of actual results from these assumptions, which are outside the control of management and can differ from our historical experience could be material. To the extent that these adjustments result in an increase, a reduction or the elimination of previously reported contract revenue, we would recognize a credit or a charge against current earnings, which could be material. Our inability to deliver our backlog on time could affect our future sales and profitability, and our relationships with our customers. Our backlog was $311.7 million at December 31, 2022 and $213.9 million at December 31, 2021. Our ability to meet customer delivery schedules for our backlog is dependent on a number of factors including, but not limited to, access to the raw materials required for production, an adequately trained and capable workforce, project engineering expertise for certain large projects, sufficient internal manufacturing plant capacity, available subcontractors and appropriate planning and scheduling of manufacturing resources. Our failure to deliver in accordance with customer expectations may result in damage to existing customer relationships and result in the loss of future business. Failure to deliver backlog in accordance with expectations could negatively impact our financial performance and cause adverse changes in the market price of our common stock. Volatility of oil and natural gas prices can adversely affect demand for our products and services. Volatility in oil and natural gas prices can impact our customers’ activity levels and spending for our products and services. Current energy prices are important contributors to cash flow for our customers and their ability to fund capital expenditures. Lower oil and natural gas prices generally lead to decreased spending by our customers. While higher oil and natural gas prices generally lead to increased spending by our customers, sustained high energy prices can be an impediment to economic growth, and can therefore negatively impact spending by our customers. Our customers also take into account the volatility of energy prices and other risk factors by requiring higher returns for individual projects if there is a higher perceived risk. Any of these factors could affect the demand for oil and natural gas and could have a material effect on our results of operations. Increasing costs for manufactured components, raw materials, transportation, health care and energy prices may adversely affect our profitability. We use a broad range of manufactured components and raw materials in our products, including raw steel, steel-related components, resin, filtration media and equipment such as fans and motors. Materials, wages and subcontracting costs comprise the largest components of our total costs. The current economic environment has resulted, and may continue to result, in price volatility and inflation of these costs. Further increases in the price of these items could further materially increase our operating costs and materially adversely affect our profit margins. Similarly, transportation, steel and health care costs have risen steadily over the past few years and represent an increasing burden for us. Although we try to contain these costs whenever possible, and although we try to pass along increased costs in the form of price increases to our customers, we may be unsuccessful in doing so, and even when successful, the timing of such price increases may lag significantly behind our incurrence of higher costs. Our financial performance may vary significantly from period to period. Our annual revenues and earnings have varied in the past and are likely to vary in the future. Our contracts generally stipulate customer-specific delivery terms and may have contract cycles of a year or more, which subjects these contracts to many factors beyond our control. In addition, contracts that are significantly larger in size than our typical contracts tend to intensify their impact on our annual operating results. Furthermore, as a significant portion of our operating costs are fixed, an unanticipated decrease in our revenues, a delay or cancellation of orders in backlog, or a decrease in the demand for our products, may have a significant impact on our annual operating results. Therefore, our annual operating results may be subject to significant variations and our operating performance in one period may not be indicative of our future performance. Customers may cancel or delay projects. As a result, our backlog may not be indicative of our future revenue. Customers may cancel or delay projects for reasons beyond our control. Our orders normally contain cancellation provisions that permit us to recover our costs, and, for most contracts, a portion of our anticipated profit in the event a customer cancels an order. If a customer elects to cancel an order, we may not realize the full amount of revenues included in our backlog. If projects are delayed, the timing of our revenues could be affected and projects may remain in our backlog for extended periods of time. Revenue recognition occurs over long periods of time and is subject to unanticipated delays. If we receive relatively large orders in any given quarter, fluctuations in the levels of our quarterly backlog can result because the backlog in that quarter may reach levels that may not be sustained in subsequent quarters. As a result, our backlog may not be indicative of our future revenues. With rare exceptions, we are not issued contracts until a customer is ready to start work on a project. Thus, it is our experience that the only relationship between the length of a project and the possibility that a project may be cancelled is simply the fact that there is more time involved. For 12 example, in a year-long project as opposed to a three-month project, more time is available for the customer to experience a softening in its business, which may cause the customer to cancel a project. We face significant competition in the markets we serve. All of the product and solution categories in which we compete are highly fragmented and competitive. We compete in industrial markets against a number of local, regional and national manufacturers and suppliers in each of our product or service lines, many of which have been in existence longer than us and some of which have substantially greater financial resources than we do. Our products primarily compete on the basis of performance, quality, reliability, lead time, on-time delivery, and safety supported by advanced engineering and operational excellence. We must also be responsive to any technological developments and related changing customer requirements. Any failure by us to compete effectively in the markets we serve could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We may incur material costs as a result of existing or future product liability claims, or other claims and litigation that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows; and our insurance coverage may not cover all claims or may be insufficient to cover the claims. Despite our quality assurance measures, we may be exposed to product liability claims, other claims and litigation in the event that the use of our products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage or our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected. Such claims may also be accompanied by fraud and deceptive trade practices claims. While we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain product liability and other claims, we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against product liability and other claims. Furthermore, our insurance may not cover damages from breach of contract by us or based on alleged fraud or deceptive trade practices. Any future damages that are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, product liability and other claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome. An unsuccessful defense of a product liability or other claim could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Even if we are successful in defending against a claim relating to our products, claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and us. Liability to customers under warranties may adversely affect our reputation, our ability to obtain future business and our results of operations. We provide certain warranties as to the proper operation and conformance to specifications of the products we manufacture or produce. Failure of our products to operate properly or to meet specifications may increase our costs by requiring additional engineering resources and services, replacement of parts and equipment or monetary reimbursement to customers. We have in the past received warranty claims, are currently subject to warranty claims, and we expect to continue to receive warranty claims in the future. To the extent that we incur substantial warranty claims in any period, our reputation, our ability to obtain future business and our results of operations could be adversely affected. Risks Related to our Business Model and Capital Structure Our gross profit may be affected by shifts in our product mix. Certain of our products have higher gross profit margins than others. Consequently, changes in the product mix of our sales from quarter-to-quarter or from year-to-year can have a significant impact on our reported gross profit margins. Certain of our products also have a much higher internally manufactured cost component. Therefore, changes from quarter-to-quarter or from year-to-year can have a significant impact on our reported gross profit margins. In addition, contracts with a higher percentage of subcontracted work or equipment purchases may result in lower gross profit margins. Our manufacturing operations are dependent on third-party suppliers. Although we are not dependent on any one supplier, we are dependent on the ability of our third-party suppliers to supply our raw materials, as well as certain specific component parts and sub-assemblies. The third-party suppliers upon which we depend may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, insolvency, lack of liquidity, adverse economic conditions, operational failure, fraud, loss of key personnel, health-related shutdowns, or other reasons. We cannot assure you that our third-party suppliers will dedicate sufficient resources to meet our scheduled delivery requirements or that our suppliers will have sufficient resources to satisfy 13 our requirements during any period of sustained demand. Failure of suppliers to supply, or delays in supplying, our raw materials or certain components, or allocations in the supply of certain high demand raw components, for any reason, including, without limitation, disruptions in our suppliers’ due to cybersecurity incidents, terrorist activity, public health crises (such as COVID-19), fires or other natural disasters could materially adversely affect our operations and ability to meet our own delivery schedules on a timely and competitive basis. Additionally, our third-party suppliers may provide us with raw materials or component parts that fail to meet our expectations or the expectations of our customers, which could subject us to product liability claims, other claims and litigation. Our use of subcontractors could potentially harm our profitability and business reputation. Occasionally we act as a prime contractor in some of the projects we undertake. In our capacity as lead provider, and when acting as a prime contractor, we perform a portion of the work on our projects with our own resources and typically subcontract activities such as manufacturing, electrical work, concrete work, insulation, conveyors and controls. In our industry, the lead contractor is normally responsible for the performance of the entire contract, including subcontract work. Thus, when acting as a prime contractor, we are subject to risk associated with the failure of one or more subcontractors to perform as anticipated. We employ subcontractors at various locations around the world to meet our customers’ needs in a timely manner, meet local content requirements and reduce costs. Subcontractors generally perform the majority of our manufacturing for international customers. We also utilize subcontractors in North America. The use of subcontractors decreases our control over the performance of these functions and could result in project delays, escalated costs and substandard quality. These risks could adversely affect our profitability and business reputation. In addition, many of our competitors, who have greater financial resources and greater bargaining power than we have, use the same subcontractors that we use and could potentially influence our ability to hire these subcontractors. If we were to lose relationships with key subcontractors, our business could be adversely impacted. A significant portion of our accounts receivable are related to larger contracts, which increases our exposure to credit risk. Significant portions of our sales are to customers who place large orders for custom products and whose activities are related to the power generation and oil & gas industries. As a result, our exposure to credit risk is affected to some degree by conditions within these industries and governmental and or political conditions. We frequently attempt to reduce our exposure to credit risk by requiring progress or milestone payments and letters of credit as well as closely monitoring the credit worthiness of our customers. However, the continuing economic climate and other unanticipated events that affect our customers could have a materially adverse impact on our operating results. Changes in billing terms can increase our exposure to working capital and credit risk. Our products are generally sold under contracts that allow us to bill upon the completion of certain agreed upon milestones or upon actual shipment of the product, and certain contracts include a retention provision. We attempt to negotiate progress-billing milestones on all large contracts to help us manage the working capital and credit risk associated with these large contracts. Consequently, shifts in the billing terms of the contracts in our backlog from period to period can increase our requirement for working capital and can increase our exposure to credit risk. Currency fluctuations may reduce profits on our foreign sales or increase our costs, either of which could adversely affect our financial results. Given that approximately 35% of our 2022 revenues are outside the United States, we are subject to the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Although our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, a portion of our sales and operating costs are realized in foreign currencies. Our sales and profitability are impacted by the movement of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in the countries in which we generate sales and conduct operations. Long-term fluctuations in relative currency values could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial conditions. 14 If our goodwill or indefinite lived intangibles become impaired, we may be required to recognize charges that would adversely impact our results of operations. As of December 31, 2022, goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles were $192.7 million, or 38.2%, of our total assets. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized, but instead are subject to annual impairment evaluations (or more frequently if circumstances require). Major factors that influence our evaluations are estimates for future revenue and expenses associated with the specific intangible asset or the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides. This is the most sensitive of our estimates related to our evaluations. Other factors considered in our evaluations include assumptions as to the business climate, industry and economic conditions. These assumptions are subjective and different estimates could have a significant impact on the results of our analyses. While management, based on current forecasts and outlooks, believes that the assumptions and estimates are reasonable, we can make no assurances that future actual operating results will be realized as planned and that there will not be material impairment charges as a result. In particular, an economic downturn could have a material adverse impact on our customers thereby forcing them to reduce or curtail doing business with us and such a result may materially affect the amount of cash flow generated by our future operations. Any write-down of goodwill or intangible assets resulting from future periodic evaluations could adversely materially impact our results of operations. We may incur costs as a result of certain restructuring activities, which may negatively impact our financial results, and we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring plans. We are continuously seeking the most cost-effective means and structure to serve our customers, protect our stockholders and respond to changes in our markets. From time to time, we may engage in restructuring activities in an effort to improve cost competitiveness and profitability. We may not achieve the desired or anticipated benefits from these restructuring activities. As a result, restructuring costs may vary significantly from year to year depending on the scope of such activities. Such restructuring costs and expenses could adversely impact our financial results. We are party to asbestos-containing product litigation that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our subsidiary, Met-Pro, along with numerous other third parties, has been named as a defendant in asbestos-related lawsuits filed against a large number of industrial companies including, in particular, those in the pump and fluid handling industries. In management’s opinion, the complaints typically have been vague, general and speculative, alleging that Met-Pro, along with the numerous other defendants, sold unidentified asbestos-containing products and engaged in other related actions that caused injuries (including death) and loss to the plaintiffs. The Company’s insurers have hired attorneys who, together with the Company, are vigorously defending these cases. The Company believes that its insurance coverage is adequate for the cases currently pending against the Company and for the foreseeable future, assuming a continuation of the current volume, nature of cases and settlement amounts. However, the Company has no control over the number and nature of cases that are filed against it, nor as to the financial health of its insurers or their position as to coverage. The Company also presently believes that none of the pending cases will have a material adverse impact upon the Company’s results of operations, liquidity or financial condition. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding the asbestos-related litigation in which we are involved. We have $112.7 million of indebtedness as of December 31, 2022, and incurrence of additional indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, remain in compliance with debt covenants, make payments on our debt and limit our growth. Our outstanding indebtedness could have important consequences for investors, including the following: •it may be more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the agreement governing our Credit Facility (as defined in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K), and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of the agreements governing any additional indebtedness, including financial and other restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under such agreements; •the covenants contained in our debt agreements, including our Credit Facility, limit our ability to borrow money in the future for acquisitions, capital expenditures or to meet our operating expenses or other general corporate obligations; •the amount of our interest expense may increase because a substantial portion of our borrowings is at variable rates of interest, which, if interest rates increase, could result in higher interest expense; •we may need to use a portion of our cash flows to pay interest on our debt, which will reduce the amount of money we have for operations, working capital, capital expenditures, expansion, acquisitions or general corporate or other business activities; 15 •we may have a higher level of debt than some of our competitors, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage; •we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our industry or the economy in general; and •our debt level could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate. Our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors. We cannot be certain that our earnings will be sufficient to allow us to pay the principal and interest on our existing or future debt and meet our other obligations. If we do not have enough money to service our existing or future debt, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing or future debt, sell assets, borrow more money or raise equity. We may not be able to refinance our existing or future debt, sell assets, borrow more money or raise equity on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Our ability to execute our growth strategies may be limited by our ability to secure and retain additional financing on terms reasonably acceptable to us or at all. Certain of our competitors are larger companies that may have greater access to capital, and therefore may have a competitive advantage over us should our access to capital be limited. We might be unable to protect our intellectual property rights and our products could infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which could expose us to costly disputes. Although we believe that our products do not infringe patents or violate the proprietary rights of others, it is possible that our existing patent rights may not be valid or that infringement of existing or future patents or proprietary rights may occur. In the event our products infringe patents or proprietary rights of others, we may be required to modify the design of our products or obtain a license for certain technology. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so in a timely manner, upon acceptable terms and conditions, or at all. Failure to do any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect upon our business. Moreover, if our products infringe patents or proprietary rights of others, we could, under certain circumstances, become liable for damages, which also could have a material adverse effect on our business. Risks related to our pension plan may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow. Significant changes in actual investment return on pension assets, discount rates and other factors may adversely affect our results of operations and pension plan contributions in future periods. GAAP requires that we calculate the income or expense of our plan using actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates. We establish the discount rate used to determine the present value of the projected and accumulated benefit obligation at the end of each year based upon the available market rates for high quality, fixed-income investments. An increase in the discount rate would increase future pension expense and, conversely, a decrease in the discount rate would decrease future pension expense. Funding requirements for our pension plan may become more significant. The ultimate amounts to be contributed are dependent upon, among other things, interest rates, underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations. We may be subject to substantial withdrawal liability assessments in the future related to multiemployer pension plans to which certain of our subsidiaries make contributions pursuant to collective bargaining agreements. Under applicable federal law, any employer contributing to a multiemployer pension plan that completely ceases participating in the plan while the plan is underfunded is subject to payment of such employer’s assessed share of the aggregate unfunded vested benefits of the plan. In certain circumstances, an employer can be assessed a withdrawal liability for a partial withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan. If any of these adverse events were to occur in the future, it could result in a substantial withdrawal liability assessment that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We have made and may make future acquisitions or divestitures, which involve numerous risks that could impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our operating strategy has involved expanding or contracting our scope of products and services through selective acquisitions or divestitures and the formation or elimination of new business units that are then integrated or separated into or out of our family of turnkey system providers. We have acquired other businesses, product or service lines, assets or technologies that are complementary to our business. We may be unable to find or consummate future acquisitions at acceptable prices and terms. We continually evaluate potential acquisition opportunities in the ordinary course of business. 16 Although we conduct what we believe to be a prudent level of investigation regarding the operating and financial condition of the businesses, product or service lines, assets or technologies we purchase, an unavoidable level of risk remains regarding their actual operating and financial condition. Until we actually assume operating control of these businesses, product or service lines, assets or technologies, we may not be able to ascertain their actual value or understand potential liabilities. This is particularly true with respect to acquisitions outside the United States. In addition, acquisitions of businesses may require additional debt or equity financing, resulting in additional leverage or dilution of ownership. Our Credit Facility contains certain covenants that limit, or which may have the effect of limiting, among other things, acquisitions, capital expenditures, the sale of assets and the incurrence of additional indebtedness. Societal responses to climate change could adversely affect our business and performance, including indirectly through impacts on our customers. Concerns over the long-term impacts of climate change have led and will continue to lead to governmental efforts around the world to mitigate those impacts. Consumers and businesses also may change their behavior as a result of these concerns. We and our customers will need to respond to new laws and regulations as well as consumer and business preferences resulting from climate change concerns. We and our customers may face cost increases, asset value reductions and operating process changes. The impact on our customers will likely vary depending on their specific attributes, including reliance on or role in carbon intensive activities. Among the impacts to us could be a drop in demand for our products and services, particularly in oil & gas industries. In addition, we could face reductions in our creditworthiness or in the value of our assets securing loans. Our efforts to take these risks into account in making business decisions, including by increasing our business with climate-friendly companies, may not be effective in protecting us from the negative impact of new laws and regulations or changes in consumer or business behavior. Global climate change and related emphasis on environmental, social and governance (""ESG"") matters by various stakeholders could negatively affect our business. Customer, investor and employee expectations relating to ESG have been rapidly evolving and increasing. In addition, government organizations are enhancing or advancing legal and regulatory requirements specific to ESG matters. The heightened stakeholder focus on ESG issues related to our business requires the continuous monitoring of various and evolving laws, regulations, standards and expectations and the associated reporting requirements. A failure to adequately meet stakeholder expectations may result in noncompliance, the loss of business, reputational impacts, diluted market valuation, an inability to attract customers and an inability to attract and retain top talent. In addition, our adoption of certain standards or mandated compliance to certain requirements could necessitate additional investments that could impact our profitability. Climate changes, such as extreme weather conditions, create financial risk to our business. Global physical climate changes, including unseasonable weather conditions, could result in reduced demand or product obsolescence for certain of our customers’ products and/or price modifications for our customers’ products and the resources needed to produce them. This could in turn put pressure on our manufacturing costs and result in reduced profit margin associated with certain of our customer programs, or loss of customer programs that we may not be able to replace. Risks Related to Human Capital Management We may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees. Our future success depends upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel, and on our ability to continue to identify, attract, retain and motivate them. Implementing our business strategy requires specialized engineering and other talent, as our revenues are highly dependent on technological and product innovations. The market for employees in our industry is extremely competitive, and competitors for talent, particularly engineering talent, increasingly attempt to hire, and to varying degrees have been successful in hiring, our employees, including by establishing local offices near our headquarters. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees, our business may be harmed. Work stoppages or similar difficulties could significantly disrupt our operations. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 200 of our approximately 1,000 employees are represented by international or independent labor unions under various union contracts that expire from May 1, 2023 to November 12, 2025. It is possible that our workforce will become more unionized in the future. Although we consider our employee relations to generally be good, our existing labor agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at one or more of our facilities, including due to the effects of COVID-19, may have a material adverse effect on our business. Unionization activities could also increase our costs, which could have an adverse effect on our profitability. 17 Additionally, a work stoppage at one of our suppliers could adversely affect our operations if an alternative source of supply were not readily available. Work stoppages by employees of our customers also could result in reduced demand for our products. Information Technology and Cybersecurity Risks Our dependence on information systems and the failure of such systems, could significantly disrupt our business and negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We are highly dependent on information systems that are increasingly operated by third parties and as a result we have a limited ability to ensure their continued operation. We rely on information technology systems, networks and infrastructure in managing our day-to-day operations. In the event of systems failure or interruption, including those related to force majeure, telecommunications failures, criminal acts, including hardware or software break-ins or extortion attempts, or viruses, or other cybersecurity incidents, we will have limited ability to affect the timing and success of systems restoration and any resulting interruption in our ability to manage and operate our business could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Increased information technology cybersecurity threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, and products. Increased global information technology cybersecurity threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and communications. While we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems, and maintenance of backup and protective systems, our systems, networks and products remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats. Depending on their nature and scope, such threats could potentially lead to the compromise of confidential information and communications, improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations. We have cybersecurity insurance related to a breach event covering expenses for notification, credit monitoring, investigation, crisis management, public relations and legal advice. However, damage and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered or exceed the amount of any insurance available or may result in increased cybersecurity and other insurance premiums. In response to an increased reliance on our information technology systems, we have taken proactive measures to strengthen our information technology systems, including completion of a National Institute of Standards and Technology (""NIST"") assessment, upgraded security patches across all servers, development of best-in-class hack protection service, implementation of recurring company-wide security training and enablement of advanced security for our major information systems. Management provides the Audit Committee with regular cybersecurity program updates including cybersecurity posture, risk management activities, and emerging risk. Furthermore, the Company may have access to sensitive, confidential, or personal data or information that may be subject to privacy and security laws, regulations, or other contractually-imposed controls. Despite our use of reasonable and appropriate controls, material security breaches, theft, misplaced, lost or corrupted data, programming, or employee errors and/or malfeasance could lead to the compromise or improper use of such sensitive, confidential, or personal data or information, resulting in possible negative consequences, such as fines, ransom demands, penalties, loss of reputation, competitiveness or customers, or other negative consequences resulting in adverse impacts to our results of operations or financial condition. Regulatory Compliance and International Operations Risks Our business can be significantly affected by changes in regulatory standards. The markets that the Company serves are characterized by competitively imposed process standards and regulatory requirements, each of which influences the demand for our products and services. Changes in legislative, regulatory or industrial requirements may render certain of our products and processes obsolete. Conversely, these changes may present new business opportunities for us. Acceptance of new products and services may also be affected by the adoption of new government regulations requiring stricter standards. Our ability to anticipate changes in regulatory standards and to respond with new and enhanced products on a timely basis will be a significant factor in our ability to grow and to remain competitive. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to achieve the technological advances that may be necessary for us to remain competitive or that certain of our products or services will not become obsolete. 18 Changes in current environmental legislation and enforcement could have an adverse impact on the sale of our environmental control systems and products and on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our business is primarily driven by capital spending, clean air rules, plant upgrades by our customers to comply with laws and regulations governing the discharge of pollutants into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment or human health. These laws include, but are not limited to, United States federal statutes such as the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Air Interstate Rule, and the regulations implementing these statutes, as well as similar laws and regulations at state and local levels and in other countries. These United States laws and regulations may change and other countries may not adopt similar laws and regulations. Our business may be adversely impacted to the extent that environmental regulations are repealed, amended, implementation dates are delayed, or to the extent that regulatory authorities reduce enforcement. Our operations outside of the United States are subject to political, investment and local business risks. For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 35% of our total revenue was derived from products or services ultimately delivered or provided to end users outside the United States. As part of our operating strategy, we intend to expand our international operations through internal growth and selected acquisitions. Operations outside of the United States, particularly in emerging markets, are subject to a variety of risks that are different from or are in addition to the risks we face within the United States. Among others, these risks include: (i) local, economic, political and social conditions, including potential hyperinflationary conditions and political instability in certain countries; (ii) tax-related risks, including the imposition of taxes and the lack of beneficial treaties, that result in a higher effective tax rate for us; (iii) imposition of limitations on the remittance of dividends and payments by foreign subsidiaries; (iv) difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign local systems; (v) domestic and foreign customs, tariffs and quotas or other trade barriers; (vi) risk of nationalization of private enterprises by foreign governments; (vii) managing and obtaining support and distribution channels for overseas operations; (viii) hiring and retaining qualified management personnel for our overseas operations; and (ix) the results of new trade agreements and changes in membership to international coalitions or unions. We are also exposed to risks relating to U.S. policy with respect to companies doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, in particular increased trade restrictions, tariffs or taxes on import from countries where we procure or manufacture products, such as China, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. For instance, the U.S. and Chinese governments have imposed a series of significant incremental retaliatory tariffs to certain imported goods. Given the uncertainty regarding the duration of the imposed tariffs, as well as the potential for additional tariffs by the U.S., China or other countries, as well as other changes in tax policy, trade regulations or trade agreements, and the Company’s ability to implement strategies to mitigate the impact of changes in tax policy, tariffs or other trade regulations, our exposure to the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, compliance with foreign and domestic legal and regulatory requirements, including import, export, defense regulations and foreign exchange controls and anti-corruption laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom’s Bribery Act, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulations and similar laws of other jurisdictions, could adversely impact our ability to compete against companies in such jurisdictions. Moreover, the violation of such laws or regulations, by us or our representatives, could result in severe penalties including monetary fines, criminal proceedings and suspension of export",49907,rf,20230306,2023,10K,real_textdata_2023
REAL_1050_01_mgmt_2023_0008,1050,01,1050:01,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 25 Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Management’s discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which include additional information about our accounting policies, practices and the transactions underlying our financial results. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes including various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, taxes, environmental and other matters arising during the normal course of business. We apply our best judgment, our knowledge of existing facts and circumstances and actions that we may undertake in the future in determining the estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience, as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances, such as current economic conditions, and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results may differ from these estimates. Overview Business Overview CECO is a leading environmentally focused, diversified industrial company, serving the broad landscape of industrial air, industrial water and energy transition markets globally providing innovative technology and application expertise. We help companies grow their business with safe, clean, and more efficient solutions that help protect people, the environment and industrial equipment. Our solutions improve air and water quality, optimize emissions management, and increase the energy and process efficiency for highly engineered applications in power generation, midstream and downstream hydrocarbon processing and transport, chemical processing, electric vehicle production, polysilicon fabrication, semiconductor and electronics production, battery production and recycling, specialty metals, aluminum and steel production, beverage can manufacturing, and industrial and produced water and wastewater treatment, and a wide range of other industrial end markets. Industry Trends and Corporate Strategy We are a global corporation with worldwide operations. As a global business, our operations are affected by worldwide, regional and industry-specific economic factors, wherever we operate or do business. Our geographic and industry diversity, and the breadth of our product and services portfolio, have helped mitigate the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on our consolidated operating results. We believe growth for our products and services is driven by the increase in demand for air quality and water treatment solutions, the energy transition, a shift towards cleaner sources of fuel such as natural gas, hydrogen, nuclear, and renewable sources, and increased awareness of our customers about corporate social responsibility and interest to procure equipment and solutions that protects employees, the environment and their industrial equipment. With a shift to cleaner, more environmentally responsible power generation, power providers and industrial power consumers are building new facilities that use cleaner fuels. In developed markets, natural gas is the largest source of electricity generation. We supply product offerings throughout the entire natural gas value chain and believe expansion will drive growth within our Engineered Systems segment for our gas separation & filtration, pressure products, acoustical equipment , water treatment solutions and DeNOx SCR systems for natural-gas-fired power plants. Increases in global natural gas, installed miles of new pipeline, including future CO2 and hydrogen pipelines, and liquified natural gas (""LNG"") demand and supply all stand to drive the need for our products. We also believe there is a growing demand to control and reduce air and water emissions from industrial facilities for which our pollution control equipment will serve. In 2021, the US Congress passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act with $550 billion of new federal spending aimed at rebuilding roads and bridges, climate resilience, and other environmental initiatives. Similar investments are being made in many other countries in which we do business. As industrial capital expenditures grow, corporations are seeking to do so with a smaller environmental impact. These regulatory and economic tailwinds coupled with shareholder pressure on companies to improve their sustainability and reduce their global carbon footprint serve as catalysts for a growing set of opportunities for our portfolio of equipment and solutions. We continue to focus on increasing revenues and profitability in developing markets, where environmental awareness and associated regulatory standards are increasing, while continuing to strengthen and expand our product offerings and channels in our domestic market of the United States. Our enterprise strategy consists of a combined operational strategy and capital allocation strategy. 25 Our operational strategy is implemented through our technology and application-based platforms aligned around target customers and end markets where our solutions are particularly valuable. Core elements of our operational strategy are commercial and operational excellence, margin expansion, recurring revenue growth, cash flow generation, product management, and project management execution. Our capital allocation strategy supports the growth and value creation generated by our operational strategy. We will focus our capital deployment on building out our leading industrial air solutions portfolio, advancing our emerging industrial water treatment position, and supporting our customers as they make the transition to cleaner more sustainable forms of energy, while also shifting our portfolio mix towards businesses with more recurring revenue and more predictable cash flows, strong secular growth trends and less cyclicality. Market Pressures The senior management team monitors and manages the Company’s ability to operate effectively as the result of market pressures, including lingering impacts of the coronavirus pandemic. In particular, we are currently experiencing shortages of raw materials and inflationary pressures for certain materials and labor. We expect these supply chain challenges and cost impacts to continue for the foreseeable future as markets recover. Although we have secured additional raw materials from existing and alternate suppliers and have taken other mitigating actions to mitigate supply disruptions, we cannot guarantee that we can continue to do so in the future. In this event, our business, results and financial condition could be adversely affected. Operations Overview We operate our platforms serving their respective niche end markets. Our platforms are structured to win in their target markets with a core focus on understanding customer needs and providing best-in-class solutions. Our business model provides scalable efficiencies enabling us to serve our customers with a variety of products that we typically classify into three categories: make-to-order, configure-to-order, and engineer-to-order. For our project-based platforms, we use an asset light business model leveraging third-party subcontract fabrication partners in a global network to execute for our customers world-wide. Our platforms are focused on sales, application engineering, product management, project management, and supply chain execution for our customers. Our operations management team has distinct industry expertise coupled with strong leadership skills resulting in a customer-first mindset across the business. Our operations management team works closely with our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer on global fulfillment strategies, operational excellence, resource allocation, and employee development. Within our segments we have monthly business reviews to ensure we are serving customers, achieving our operating plan, and executing on strategic growth initiatives. These reviews include, but are not limited to pipeline reviews, quotation reviews, project management reviews, financial performance, manufacturing scorecards, safety, and customer feedback. In these reviews we focus on metrics such as quality, customer satisfaction, on-time-delivery, lead-times, price, inflation, project margins, backlog, and above all, safety. In support of the platforms, centralized teams provide back-office functions for scale, efficiency, and compliance. These key functions include: accounting, treasury, tax, payroll, benefits management, legal, information technology, marketing, and internal control over financial reporting. We have excellent collaboration between our platforms and our centralized service teams ensuring optimal efficiency and alignment on growth and improvement initiatives. Our reportable segments are: •Engineered Systems segment: Our Engineered Systems segment serves the power generation, hydrocarbon processing, water/wastewater treatment, oily water separation and treatment, marine and naval vessels, and midstream oil & gas sectors. We are a key part of helping meet the global demand for environmental and equipment protection solutions with our highly engineered platforms including emissions control, fluid bed cyclones, thermal acoustics, separation & filtration, and dampers & expansion joints. •Industrial Solutions segment: Our Industrial Process Solutions segment serves the broad industrial sector with solutions for air pollution and contamination control, fluid handling, and process filtration in applications such as aluminum beverage can production, automobile production, food and beverage processing, semiconductor fabrication, electronics production, steel and aluminum mill processing, wood manufacturing, desalination, and aquaculture markets. For Industrial Air applications, we assist companies maintain clean and safe operations for employees, reduce energy consumption, minimize waste for 26 customers, and ensure they meet regulatory standards for toxic emissions, fumes, volatile organic compounds, and odor elimination through our platforms including duct fabrication & installation, industrial air, and fluid handling. Our contracts are obtained either through competitive bidding or as a result of negotiations with our customers. Contract terms offered by us are generally dependent on the complexity and risk of the project as well as the resources that will be required to complete the project. Our focus is on increasing our operating margins as well as our gross margin percentage, which translates into stronger operating results. Our cost of sales is principally driven by a number of factors, including material and subcontract prices and labor cost and availability. Changes in these factors may have a material impact on our overall gross profit margins. We break down costs of sales into five categories. They are: •Subcontracts—Electrical work, concrete work, subcomponents and other subcontracts necessary to produce our products; •Labor—Our direct labor both in the shop and in the field; •Material—Raw material that we buy to build our products; •Equipment—Fans, motors, control panels and other equipment necessary for turnkey systems; and •Factory overhead—Costs of facilities and supervision wages necessary to produce our products. In general, subcontracts are the highest percentage of costs and also the most flexible followed by labor, material, and equipment. Due to the project nature and global orientation of several of our platforms, leveraging subcontract fabrication partners close to our customers increases our ability to meet customer delivery expectations at market competitive pricing. In periods where orders are infrequent, we do not have to maintain the fixed cost of a manufacturing plant. Across our various product lines, the relative relationships of these cost categories change and cause variations in gross margin percentage. Material and labor costs can increase fast, which also reduces gross margin percentage. As material cost inflation occurs, the Company seeks to pass this cost onto our customers as price increases. Selling and administrative expense principally includes sales and engineering payroll and related fringes, advertising and marketing expenditures as well as all corporate and administrative functions and other costs that support our operations. The majority of these expenses are fixed. An advantage of our asset light model is that as revenue grows, we have significant operating leverage on our fixed selling and administrative cost structure. Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). These GAAP financial statements include certain charges the Company believes are not indicative of its ongoing operational performance. As a result, the Company provides financial information in this MD&A that was not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to the information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company provides this supplemental non-GAAP financial information, which the Company’s management utilizes to evaluate its ongoing financial performance, and which the Company believes provides greater transparency to investors as supplemental information to its GAAP results. The Company has provided the non-GAAP financial measures including non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP net income as a result of the adjustment for items that the Company believes are not indicative of its ongoing operations. These items include charges associated with the Company’s acquisitions, divestitures and the items described below in “Consolidated Results.” The Company believes that evaluation of its financial performance compared with prior and future periods can be enhanced by a presentation of results that exclude the impact of these items. The Company has incurred substantial expense and generated substantial income associated with acquisitions and divestitures. While the Company cannot predict the exact timing or amounts of such charges, it does expect to treat these charges as special items in its future presentation of non-GAAP results. 27 Results of Operations Consolidated Results Our consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 are as follows: Year ended December 31, (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Net sales $ 422.6 $ 324.1 $ 316.0 Cost of goods sold 294.4 223.2 210.9 Gross profit $ 128.2 $ 100.9 $ 105.1 Percent of sales 30.3 % 31.1 % 33.3 % Selling and administrative expenses $ 93.4 $ 81.8 $ 76.9 Percent of sales 22.1 % 25.2 % 24.3 % Amortization and earnout expenses 6.8 7.8 8.8 Acquisition and integration expenses 4.5 0.8 1.4 Executive transition expenses 1.2 — 1.5 Restructuring expenses 0.1 0.6 2.3 Intangible asset impairment — — 0.9 Operating income $ 22.2 $ 9.9 $ 13.3 Percent of sales 5.3 % 3.1 % 4.2 % Non-GAAP Measures To compare operating performance between the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company has adjusted GAAP operating income to exclude (1) amortization of intangible assets, earnout and retention expenses, (2) restructuring expenses primarily relating to severance, facility exits, and associated legal expenses, (3) acquisition and integration expenses, which include legal, accounting, and other expenses, (4) executive transition expenses, including severance for the Company's former executives, fees and expenses incurred in the search, for and hiring, of new executives and (5) intangible asset impairment. See “Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” above. The following tables present the reconciliation of GAAP operating income and GAAP operating margin to non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin, and GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income. Year Ended December 31, (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Operating income as reported in accordance with GAAP $ 22.2 $ 9.9 $ 13.3 Operating margin in accordance with GAAP 5.3 % 3.1 % 4.2 % Amortization and earnout expenses 6.8 7.8 8.8 Acquisition and integration expenses 4.5 0.8 1.4 Executive transition expenses 1.2 — 1.5 Restructuring expenses 0.1 0.6 2.3 Intangible asset impairment — — 0.9 Non-GAAP operating income $ 34.8 $ 19.1 $ 28.2 Non-GAAP operating margin 8.2 % 5.9 % 8.9 % Year Ended December 31, (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Net income as reported in accordance with GAAP $ 17.4 $ 1.4 $ 8.2 Amortization and earnout expenses 6.8 7.8 8.8 Acquisition and integration expenses 4.5 0.8 1.4 Executive transition expenses 1.2 — 1.5 Restructuring expenses 0.1 0.6 2.3 Intangible asset impairment — — 0.9 Foreign currency remeasurement (1.3 ) 2.0 0.3 Tax (benefit) expense of adjustments (2.8 ) (2.8 ) (3.9 ) Non-GAAP net income $ 25.9 $ 9.8 $ 19.5 Non-GAAP net income as a percentage of sales 6.1 % 3.0 % 6.2 % 28 Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 Consolidated net sales in 2022 were $422.6 million compared with $324.1 million in 2021, an increase of $98.5 million. The increase is broad-based, led by increases of $23.0 million in our thermal acoustics technologies, $22.2 million across our entire industrial process solutions platforms, $17.8 million in our emissions management technologies, $14.4 million in our dampers and expansion joint products, and $6.9 million in engineered cyclone systems. Approximately 80.9%, or $79.7 million, of the increase in net sales is attributable to organic revenue growth, while $18.8 million is attributable to current year acquisitions. Gross profit increased by $27.3 million, or 27.1%, to $128.2 million in 2022 compared with $100.9 million in 2021. The increase in gross profit is primarily attributable to the increase in sales volume as described above. Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 30.3% in 2022 compared with 31.1% in 2021 due to inflation, supply chain challenges, and lower project margin mix executed during 2022, partially offset by price increases. We continue to experience shortages of raw materials and inflationary pressures for certain materials and labor. We expect these supply chain challenges and cost impacts to continue for the foreseeable future as markets recover. Although we have secured additional raw materials from existing and alternate suppliers and have taken other mitigating actions to mitigate supply disruptions, such as implementing price increases and applying material surcharges, we cannot guarantee that we can continue to do so in the future. In this event, our business, results and financial condition could be adversely affected. Orders booked were $526.6 million in 2022 compared with $360.8 million in 2021. This 46% increase is attributable to increases of $66.8 million in our separation and filtration technologies, $53.9 million in our emissions management technologies, $22.0 million in industrial air control technologies and $21.4 million in our thermal acoustics technologies. Of the $165.8 million increase in orders, $143.2 million, or 86.4%, is attributable to organic growth while $22.6 million is attributable to current year acquisitions. Selling and administrative expenses were $93.4 million in 2022 compared with $81.8 million in 2021. The increase is primarily attributed to acquisitions during 2022, as well as increased headcount in order to support our revenue growth. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 22.1% in 2022 compared with 25.2% in 2021. The decrease in percentage is primarily attributable to gaining operating leverage on increased organic revenues. Amortization and earnout expense was $6.8 million in 2022 and $7.8 million in 2021. The decrease in expense is primarily attributable to a decrease of $1.3 million in earnout expense, partially offset by a $0.3 million increase in definite lived asset amortization. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on earnout expenses. Acquisitions and integration expenses related to various merger and acquisition diligence activities, which include legal, accounting and banking expenses, were $4.5 million in 2022, as compared with $0.8 million in 2021. The increase is due to an increase in acquisition activity (including General Rubber LLC, Compass Water Solutions, Inc., Western Air Ducts Limited and DS21 Co., Ltd. as described in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) during 2022. Operating income for 2022 was $22.2 million, an increase of $12.3 million from $9.9 million in 2021. Operating income as a percentage of sales for 2022 was 5.3% compared with 3.1% for 2021. The increase in operating income is primarily attributable to increases in net organic sales and gaining operating leverage. Non-GAAP operating income was $34.8 million in 2022 and $19.1 million in 2021. The increase in non-GAAP operating income is primarily attributable to the increase in net organic sales. Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of sales for 2022 was 8.2% compared with 5.9% for 2021. Other income for 2022 was $6.9 million, an increase of $9.1 million from $2.2 million other expense in 2021. The increase in other income was primarily attributable to net foreign currency transaction gains in the current year based on changes in exchange rates at our foreign subsidiaries. Interest expense increased to $5.4 million in 2022 from $3.0 million in 2021. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to increased debt balances to fund current year acquisitions. Income tax expense was $5.4 million and $2.7 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The effective tax rate for 2022 was 22.9% compared with 57.6% in 2021. Income tax expense and the effective tax rate for 2022 were affected by certain permanent differences, including state income taxes, non-deductible incentive stock-based compensation, and differences in tax rates among the jurisdictions in which we operate. 29 Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 See the Management Discussion and Analysis section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 for a discussion of our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, which information is incorporated by reference herein. Business Segments The Company’s operations are organized and reviewed by management along its product lines and end markets that the segment serves and are presented in two reportable segments. The results of the segments are reviewed through the “Income from operations” line on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The amounts presented in the Net Sales table below and in the following comments regarding our net sales at the reportable business segment level exclude both intra-segment and inter-segment net sales. The Income from Operations table and corresponding comments regarding operating income (loss) at the reportable segment level include both intra-segment and inter-segment operating income. 2022 2021 2020 Net Sales (less intra-, inter-segment sales) (table only in thousands) Engineered Systems Segment $ 263,224 $ 186,926 $ 205,494 Industrial Process Solutions Segment 159,403 137,214 110,517 Total net sales $ 422,627 $ 324,140 $ 316,011 2022 2021 2020 Income from Operations (table only in thousands) Engineered Systems segment $ 36,200 $ 25,770 $ 34,170 Industrial Process Solutions segment 22,705 15,054 7,220 Corporate and Other (1) (36,744 ) (30,967 ) (28,044 ) Total income from operations $ 22,161 $ 9,857 $ 13,346 (1)Includes corporate compensation, professional services, information technology, and other general, administrative corporate expenses. This figure excludes earnout expenses / income, which are recorded in the segment in which the expense / income occurs. Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 Engineered Systems segment Our Engineered Systems segment net sales increased $76.3 million to $263.2 million in 2022 compared with $186.9 million in 2021, an increase of 40.8%. The increase is broad-based, led by increases of $23.0 million in our thermal acoustics technologies, $17.8 million in our emissions management technologies, $14.4 million in our dampers and expansion joint products, and $6.9 million in engineered cyclone systems. Approximately 77.3%, or $59.0 million, of the increase in net sales is attributable to organic revenue growth, while $17.3 million is attributable to current year acquisitions. Operating income for the Engineered Systems segment increased $10.4 million to $36.2 million for 2022 compared with $25.8 million in 2021, an increase of 40.3%. The increase in operating income in primarily attributable to higher gross profit related to increased sales of $76.3 million. Industrial Process Solutions segment Our Industrial Process Solutions segment net sales increased $22.2 million to $159.4 million in 2022 compared with $137.2 million in 2021, an increase of 16.2%. The increase is primarily attributable to increases across all products serving industrial air end markets. Approximately 93.2%, or $20.7 million, of the increase in net sales is attributable to organic revenue growth, while $1.5 million is attributable to current year acquisitions. 30 Operating income increased $7.6 million to $22.7 million for 2022 compared with $15.1 million in 2021. The increase is primarily attributable to higher gross profit driven by increased net sales and a $1.1 million decrease in earnout expense, partially offset by a $2.9 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses. Corporate and Other segment Operating expense for the Corporate and Other segment increased $5.7 million to $36.7 million for 2022 compared with $31.0 million for 2021. The increase is primarily attributable to inflationary increases in wages and services, and executive transition expenses of $1.2 million, partially offset by a $2.5 million favorable insurance settlement received in the first quarter of 2022. Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 See the Management Discussion and Analysis section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 for a discussion of business segment results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, which information is incorporated by reference herein. Liquidity and Capital Resources When we undertake large jobs, our working capital objective is to make these projects self-funding. We work to achieve this by obtaining initial down payments, progress billing contracts, when possible, utilizing extended payment terms from material suppliers, and paying sub-contractors after payment from our customers, which is an industry practice. Our investment in net working capital is funded by cash flow from operations and by our revolving line of credit. At December 31, 2022, the Company had working capital of $94.0 million, compared with $72.3 million at December 31, 2021. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 1.64 to 1.00 at December 31, 2022 as compared with a ratio of 1.62 to 1.00 at December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, cash and cash equivalents totaled $45.5 million and $29.9 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, $31.7 million and $24.8 million, respectively, of our cash and cash equivalents were held by non-U.S. subsidiaries, as well as being denominated in foreign currencies. Debt consisted of the following: December 31, (table only in thousands) 2022 2021 Outstanding borrowings under Credit Facility Term loan payable in quarterly principal installments of $550 through September 2023, $825 through September 2025 and $1,100 thereafter with balance due upon maturity in December 2026. – Term loan $ 41,309 $ 43,511 – Revolving Credit Loan 61,300 22,000 Total outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility 102,609 65,511 Outstanding borrowings under the joint venture term debt 10,083 — Unamortized debt discount (1,488 ) (1,731 ) Total outstanding borrowings 111,204 63,780 Less: current portion (3,579 ) (2,203 ) Total debt, less current portion $ 107,625 $ 61,577 In 2022, the Company made repayments of $2.2 million on the term loan and $0.9 million on the joint venture term debt, and net borrowings on the revolving credit line of $39.3 million. Credit Facility The Company's outstanding borrowings in the United States consist of a senior secured term loan and a senior secured revolver loan with sub-facilities for letters of credit, swing-line loans and multi-currency loans (collectively, the ""Credit Facility""). Under the terms of the Credit Facility, the Company is required to maintain certain financial covenants, including the maintenance of a Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility). Through September 30, 2023, the maximum Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio is 3.75, after which time it will decrease to 3.50 until the end of the term of the Credit Facility. 31 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company was in compliance with all related financial and other restrictive covenants under the Credit Facility. Joint Venture Debt On March 7, 2022, the Company's Effox-Flextor-Mader, Inc. joint venture (""EFM JV"") entered into a loan agreement secured by the assets of the EFM JV in the aggregate principal amount of $11.0 million for the acquisition of General Rubber, LLC (""GRC""), as further described in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Foreign Debt In addition, the Company has a number of bank guarantee facilities and bilateral lines of credit in various foreign countries currently supported by cash, letters of credit or pledged assets and collateral under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility allows letters of credit and bank guarantee issuances of up to $65.0 million from the bilateral lines of credit secured by pledged assets and collateral under the Credit Facility. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Company’s debt facilities. Total unused credit availability under our Credit Facility and other non-U.S. credit facilities and agreements, exclusive of any potential asset base limitations, is as follows: December 31, 2022 2021 (dollars in millions) Credit Facility, revolving loans $ 140.0 $ 140.0 Draw down (61.3 ) (22.0 ) Letters of credit open (18.9 ) (14.5 ) Total unused credit availability $ 59.8 $ 103.5 Amount available based on borrowing limitations $ 59.8 $ 45.9 Overview of Cash Flows and Liquidity For the year ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 2020 Total operating cash flow provided by operating activities $ 29,649 $ 13,298 $ 4,421 Net cash used in investing activities (48,257 ) (2,083 ) (9,235 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 38,176 (15,556 ) 3,724 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (4,978 ) (1,475 ) 1,943 Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 14,590 $ (5,816 ) $ 853 Operating Activities In 2022, $29.6 million of cash was provided by operating activities compared with $13.3 million provided by operating activities in 2021, an increase of $16.3 million. Cash flow from operating activities in 2022 had a favorable impact year-over-year primarily due to increases in net earnings, partially offset by increases in net working capital. In 2021, $13.2 million of cash was provided by operating activities compared with $4.4 million in 2020, an increase of $8.8 million. Cash flow from operating activities in 2021 had a favorable impact year-over-year primarily due to certain improvements in net working capital, partially offset by decreases in net earnings. Investing Activities In 2022, $48.3 million of cash was used in investing activities, which consisted of $44.9 for current year acquisitions and $3.4 million for acquisition of property and equipment. In 2021, $2.1 million of cash was used in investing activities, which consisted of $2.6 million for acquisition of property and equipment, offset by $0.5 million of proceeds from the disposal of assets held for sale. 32 Financing Activities Financing activities in 2022 provided cash of $38.2 million, which consisted primarily of $39.3 million net borrowings on our revolving credit line and $11.0 million borrowings of joint venture term debt, both of which were used to finance current year acquisitions. These were partially offset by $3.1 million paydown of our term debt, $7.0 million for the repurchase and retirement of our common stock, $1.4 million in distributions to non-controlling interest, and $0.6 million in payments on our capital leases. Financing activities in 2021 used cash of $15.6 million, which consisted primarily of $5.7 million net payments on our revolving credit line, $2.7 million paydown of our term debt, $5.0 million for the repurchase and retirement of our common stock, $0.8 million in deferred financing fees paid, $0.8 million in earnout payments, and $0.6 million in payments on our capital leases. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations and borrowing availability under the Credit Facility. We believe that cash flows from operating activities, together with our existing cash and borrowings available under our Credit Facility, will be sufficient for at least the next twelve months to fund our current anticipated uses of cash. After that, our ability to fund these expected uses of cash and to comply with the financial covenants under our debt agreements will depend on the results of future operations, performance and cash flow. Our ability to fund these expected uses from the results of future operations will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business, regulatory, legislative and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our material cash requirements included (i) debt repayments under with respect to our Credit Facility and joint venture term debt, (ii) interest expense, (iii) purchase obligations for costs associated with uncompleted sales contracts, (iv) operating and capital lease obligations and (v) contingent liabilities related to acquisitions, including earnout liabilities and retention payments. We are party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties, and such commitments require a material amount of cash. The following table summarizes the Company’s material cash requirements from known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2022: Payments Due by Period (dollars in thousands) Total Less than 1year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than5 years Term Loan Debt, including joint venture debt $ 51,392 $ 3,579 $ 10,093 $ 37,720 $ — Revolving Credit Loan 61,300 — — 61,300 — Interest expense (estimated) 25,438 7,508 14,145 3,785 — Purchase obligations (1) 131,225 131,225 — — — Operating lease obligations 12,861 3,405 5,354 2,211 1,891 Capital lease obligations 7,316 907 1,868 1,944 2,597 Liabilities related to acquisitions (2) 2,700 1,200 1,500 — — Totals $ 292,232 $ 147,824 $ 32,960 $ 106,960 $ 4,488 (1)Primarily consists of purchase obligations for costs associated with uncompleted sales contracts. (2)Includes notes payable and expected earnout liability. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. We believe that, of our significant accounting policies, the following accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgments, estimates, and complexity. Use of Estimates Preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenues, bad debts, warranties, share based compensation, income taxes, goodwill and intangible asset valuation, and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 33 Revenue Recognition A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from fixed-price contracts. We account for a contract after it has been approved by all parties to the arrangement, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. We recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and services. A significant amount of our revenue is recognized over a period of time as we perform under the contract because control of the work in process transfers continuously to the customer. For performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. Progress is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs to complete the performance obligation. For these contracts, the cost-to-cost measure best depicts the continuous transfer of goods or services to the customer. The judgments and estimates involved include management’s ability to accurately estimate the contracts’ progress to completion at each financial reporting period. In addition, certain contracts are highly dependent on the work of contractors and other subcontractors participating in a project, over which we have no or limited control, and their performance on such project could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our contracts. Delays resulting from these contractors and subcontractors, changes in the scope of the project, weather, and labor availability also can have an effect on a contract’s profitability. Changes to job performance, job conditions, and estimated profitability may result in revisions to contract revenue and costs and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are made. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. No provision for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts was needed at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Inventories The Company’s inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in, first-out inventory costing method. Inventory quantities are regularly reviewed and provisions for excess or obsolete inventory are recorded primarily based on the Company’s forecast of future demand and market conditions. Significant unanticipated changes to the Company’s forecasts could require a change in the provision for excess or obsolete inventory. Long-lived assets Property, plant and equipment and finite life intangible assets are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment. If events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment, our impairment review is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level at which cash flows of the long-lived assets are largely independent of other groups of our assets and liabilities. This analysis requires management judgment with respect to changes in technology, the continued success of product lines, and future volume, revenue and expense growth rates. We conduct annual reviews for idle and underutilized equipment, and review business plans for possible impairment. Impairment occurs when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be earned by the use of the asset or asset group. When impairment is indicated, the estimated future cash flows are then discounted to determine the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value. Additionally, we also evaluate the remaining useful life each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of depreciation or amortization. If the estimate of a long-lived asset’s remaining useful life is changed, the remaining carrying amount of the asset is amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life. The Company completes an annual (or more often if circumstances require) impairment assessment of its indefinite life intangible assets. As a part of its annual assessment, typically, the Company first qualitatively assesses whether current events or changes in circumstances lead to a determination that it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of an asset is less than its carrying amount. If there is a qualitative determination that the fair value of a particular asset is more likely than not greater than its carrying value, we do not need to proceed to the quantitative estimated fair value test for that asset. If this qualitative assessment indicates a more likely than not potential that the asset may be impaired, the estimated fair value is determined by the relief from royalty method. If the estimated fair value of an asset is less than its carrying value, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. During 2022 and 2021, our annual impairment test indicated no impairment of our indefinite-lived tradenames. Accordingly, we recognized no impairment charges in our financial results for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. For additional information on impairment testing results, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 34 Goodwill The Company completes an annual (or more often if circumstances require) goodwill impairment assessment on October 1 on a reporting unit level, at or below the operating segment level. As a part of its annual assessment, the Company first qualitatively assesses whether current events or changes in circumstances lead to a determination that it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If there is a qualitative determination that the fair value of a particular reporting unit is more likely than not greater than its carrying value, the Company does not need to quantitatively test for goodwill impairment for that reporting unit. If this qualitative assessment indicates a more likely than not potential that the asset may be impaired, the estimated fair value is calculated using a weighting of the income method and the market method. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment charge is recorded. The Company bases its measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit using a 50/50 weighting of the income method and the market method. The income method is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses the significant assumptions of projected revenue, projected operational profit, terminal growth rates, and the cost of capital. Projected revenue, projected operational profit and terminal growth rates are significant assumptions because they are three primary drivers of the projected cash flows in the discounted future cash flow approach. Cost of capital is a significant assumption as it is the discount rate used to calculate the current fair value of those projected cash flows. The market method is based on financial multiples of comparable companies and applies a control premium. Significant estimates in the market approach include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit. Based on the analysis, the resultant estimated fair value of all of the reporting units exceeded their carrying value as of December 31, 2022. For additional information on goodwill impairment testing results, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes Income taxes are determined using the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 740, “Income Taxes”. Income tax expense includes federal, state and foreign income taxes. Deferred income taxes are provided using the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. Tax credits and other incentives reduce income tax expense in the year the credits are claimed. Management must assess the need to accrue or disclose uncertain tax positions for proposed potential adjustments from various federal, state and foreign tax authorities who regularly audit the Company in the normal course of business. In making these assessments, management must often analyze complex tax laws of multiple jurisdictions, including many foreign jurisdictions. The accounting guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company records the related interest expense and penalties, if any, as tax expense in the tax provision. Management must assess the realizability of the Company’s deferred tax assets. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities (including the impact of available carryback and carry forward periods), projected future taxable income, and tax-planning strategies in making this assessment. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced. The Company has made an accounting policy election to record the U.S. income tax effect of future global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) inclusions in the period in which they arise, rather than establishing deferred taxes with respect to the expected future tax liabilities associated with future GILTI inclusion. Certain of the Company’s undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries are not permanently reinvested. A liability has been recorded for the deferred taxes on such",48289,mgmt,20230306,2023,10K,real_textdata_2023

We also suggest that management’s discussion and analysis appearing in this report be read in conjunction with the management’s discussion and analysis and consolidated financial statements included in our 2022 Annual Report. Business OverviewPROG Holdings, Inc. (""we,"" ""our,"" ""us,"" the ""Company,"" or ""PROG Holdings"") is a financial technology holding company that provides transparent and competitive payment options to consumers. PROG Holdings has two reportable segments: (i) Progressive Leasing, an in-store, app-based, and e-commerce point-of-sale lease-to-own solutions provider; and (ii) Vive Financial (""Vive""), an omnichannel provider of second-look revolving credit products.Our Progressive Leasing segment provides consumers with lease-purchase solutions through its point-of-sale partner locations and e-commerce website partners (collectively, ""POS partners""). It does so by purchasing the merchandise from the POS partners desired by customers and, in turn, leasing that merchandise to the customers through a cancellable lease-to-own transaction. Progressive Leasing has no stores of its own, but rather offers lease-purchase solutions to the customers of traditional and e-commerce retailers.Our Vive segment primarily serves customers that may not qualify for traditional prime lending offers who desire to purchase goods and services from participating merchants. Vive offers customized programs with services that include revolving loans through private label and Vive-branded credit cards. Vive's current network of POS partner locations and e-commerce websites includes furniture, mattresses, home exercise equipment, and home improvement retailers, as well as medical and dental service providers.On June 25, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of Four Technologies, Inc. (""Four""), an innovative Buy Now, Pay Later company that allows shoppers to pay for merchandise through four interest-free installments. Four’s proprietary platform capabilities and its base of customers and retailers expand PROG Holdings’ ecosystem of financial technology offerings by introducing a payment solution that further diversifies the Company's consumer financial technology offerings. Shoppers use Four to purchase furniture, clothing, electronics, health and beauty products, footwear, jewelry, and other consumer goods from retailers across the United States. Four is not expected to be a reportable segment in 2023 as its financial results are not expected to be material to the Company's consolidated financial results in 2023. Four's financial results are reported within ""Other"" for segment reporting purposes.Macroeconomic and Business EnvironmentThe Company continues to operate in a challenging macroeconomic environment. The rapid increase in the rate of inflation during 2022, which has continued in 2023, particularly in gas, food, and housing costs, which we believe disproportionately negatively affects the customers we serve and therefore our customers' ability to make the payments they owe to the Company. These macroeconomic challenges have resulted in an unfavorable impact on our lease portfolio performance and Gross Merchandise Volume (""GMV"") during 2022 and the first quarter of 2023. Customer payment delinquencies and uncollectible renewal payments experienced within our Progressive Leasing segment during much of 2022 significantly exceeded levels experienced during pre-pandemic periods. In response to increasing customer delinquencies and higher write-offs, Progressive Leasing tightened its lease decisioning several times during 2022, resulting in fewer lease approvals and an adverse impact on GMV in 2022 and the first quarter of 2023. Levels of customer payment delinquencies and uncollectible renewal payments for leases originated after Progressive Leasing further tightened its lease decisioning in mid-2022 improved to levels consistent with pre-pandemic lease portfolio performance. The relatively high levels of customer payment delinquencies and related write-offs associated with leases originated prior to the Company's further tightening of its lease decisioning in mid-2022 may 21continue for an extended period of time, and/or may increase to even higher levels, which would have an unfavorable impact on our performance. Furthermore, increasing unemployment rates and/or a recession in the United States may result in increasing levels of customer payment delinquencies and related write-offs, which would result in an unfavorable impact on our performance.The significant increase in inflation and interest rates, and fears of a possible recession have also unfavorably impacted consumer confidence within our customer base, resulting in a decrease in demand for the types of merchandise offered by many of our key national and regional POS partners. In light of these macroeconomic challenges and to align the cost structure of our business with our near-term revenue outlook, the Company executed on a number of cost reduction initiatives during 2022 and the first quarter of 2023 to drive efficiencies and right-size variable costs, while attempting to minimize the negative impact on growth-related initiatives.COVID-19 Pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy in recent years, including the businesses and operations of our POS partners and our own businesses. For example, the significant increase in COVID-19 cases resulted in many of our POS partners temporarily closing showrooms and/or reducing the hours and scope of operations of their showrooms, and also resulted in increases in employee absenteeism and declines in customer traffic for many of our POS partners, all of which unfavorably impacted Progressive Leasing's GMV. In addition, other pandemic-related factors unfavorably impacted many of our POS partners, including supply chain disruptions resulting in shortages of available products at certain POS partners, primarily in appliances, electronics and furniture categories. Those and other pandemic-related developments, may adversely impact Progressive Leasing's generation of new lease agreements, Vive's generation of new loans, and our results of operations, financial condition, cash flow and/or liquidity in future periods.The extent of any such adverse, pandemic-related impacts will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, for example, the emergence of more contagious and harmful variants of COVID-19, and localized outbreaks or additional waves of COVID-19 cases and the impact of any such outbreaks on our customers, POS partners, and employees.HighlightsThe following summarizes significant financial highlights from the three months ended March 31, 2023:•We reported revenues of $655.1 million, a decrease of 7.8% compared to the first quarter of 2022. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to a 15.4% decrease in consolidated GMV for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to the same period in the prior year, due to tightened lease decisioning by Progressive Leasing in mid-2022, and decreased customer demand for many of the products offered by our POS partners. Revenues were also impacted by a smaller lease portfolio at the beginning of the quarter as compared to the first quarter of 2022, and a decline in the number of customers electing to exercise early lease buyouts when compared to the same period in the prior year. The decline in revenues was partially offset by improved customer payment activity in the first quarter of 2023, as compared to the first quarter of 2022.•GMV decreased by $85.8 million for Progressive Leasing and $6.1 million for Vive in the first quarter of 2023, compared to the same period in the prior year. These decreases were due to tighter lease and loan decisioning, resulting in fewer lease and loan originations, and the rapid increase in the rate of inflation eroding customers' disposable incomes and reducing their demand for many of the goods sold by our POS partners. These negative impacts were partially offset by GMV from our other operations, which increased by $6.5 million primarily due to an increase in Four loan originations in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022. •Earnings before income taxes increased to $67.6 million compared to $39.8 million in the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily driven by fewer customers electing early lease buyouts, improved customer payment activity, and lower operating costs resulting from recent cost cutting initiatives.22Key Operating MetricsGross Merchandise Volume. We believe GMV is a key performance indicator of our Progressive Leasing and Vive segments, as it provides the total value of new leases and loans written into our portfolio over a specified time period. GMV does not represent revenues earned by the Company, but rather is a leading indicator we use in forecasting revenues the Company may earn in the short-term. Progressive Leasing's GMV is defined as the retail price of merchandise acquired by Progressive Leasing, which it then expects to lease to its customers. GMV for Vive and Other are defined as gross loan originations. The following table presents our GMV for the Company for the periods presented:Three Months Ended March 31,Change(Unaudited and In Thousands)20232022$%Progressive Leasing$418,683 $504,462 $(85,779)(17.0)%Vive36,530 42,614 (6,084)(14.3)Other13,607 7,086 6,521 92.0 Total GMV$468,820 $554,162 $(85,342)(15.4)%The decrease in Progressive Leasing's and Vive's GMV was primarily due to our tighter lease and loan decisioning to address the unfavorable economic conditions that were present in 2022, resulting in fewer lease and loan approvals; the rapid increase in the rate of inflation, which eroded customers' disposable incomes and their demand for many of the goods sold by our POS partners. We believe these factors have unfavorably impacted the generation of new leases and loans. E-commerce channels generated 16.9% of Progressive Leasing's GMV in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 15.9% in the first quarter of 2022. The decrease in total GMV was also partially offset by an increase in GMV from our other operations, primarily due to an increase in Four loan originations from new and existing retail partners.Active Customer Count. Our active customer count represents the total number of customers that have an active lease agreement with Progressive Leasing, or an active loan with Vive or Four. The following table presents our consolidated active customer count, which includes an immaterial number of customers that have both an active lease agreement and loan agreement, for the Company for the periods presented:As of March 31 (Unaudited)20232022Active Customer Count:Progressive Leasing861,000 974,000 Vive89,000 88,000 Other28,000 17,000 Total Active Customer Count978,000 1,079,000 The decrease in the number of Progressive Leasing customers was primarily due to a decrease in customer demand for the types of merchandise typically purchased through our lease-to-own solutions and the tightening of our lease decisioning in 2022 to address the unfavorable economic conditions that were driving higher customer payment delinquencies and uncollectible renewal payments during much of 2022. The number of Vive customers remained consistent compared to the first quarter of 2022. The increase in the number of customers in Other was primarily driven by continued growth in loan originations from our Four business.Key Components of Earnings Before Income TaxesIn this MD&A section, we review our condensed consolidated results. For the three months ended March 31, 2023 and the comparable prior year period, some of the key revenue, cost and expense items that affected earnings before income taxes were as follows: Revenues. We separate our total revenues into two components: (i) lease revenues and fees and (ii) interest and fees on loans receivable. Lease revenues and fees include all revenues derived from lease agreements from our Progressive Leasing segment. Lease revenues are recorded net of a provision for uncollectible renewal payments. Interest and fees on loans receivable represents merchant fees, finance charges and annual and other fees earned on outstanding loans in our Vive segment and, to a lesser extent, from Four.Depreciation of Lease Merchandise. Depreciation of lease merchandise primarily reflects the expense associated with depreciating merchandise leased to customers by Progressive Leasing.23Provision for Lease Merchandise Write-offs. The provision for lease merchandise write-offs represents the estimated merchandise losses incurred but not yet identified by management and adjustments for changes in estimates for the allowance for lease merchandise write-offs.Operating Expenses. Operating expenses include personnel costs, stock-based compensation expense, occupancy costs, advertising, professional services expense, sales acquisition expense, computer software expense, bank service charges, the provision for loan losses, fixed asset depreciation expense, intangible asset amortization, and restructuring, among other expenses.Interest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net consists of interest incurred on the Company's Senior Notes and senior secured revolving credit facility (the ""Revolving Facility""). Interest expense is presented net of interest income earned on the Company's deposits in cash and cash equivalents. 24Results of Operations – Three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 Three Months Ended March 31,Change(In Thousands)20232022$%REVENUES:Lease Revenues and Fees$637,082 $692,914 $(55,832)(8.1)%Interest and Fees on Loans Receivable18,058 17,550 508 2.9 655,140 710,464 (55,324)(7.8)COSTS AND EXPENSES:Depreciation of Lease Merchandise435,439 497,011 (61,572)(12.4)Provision for Lease Merchandise Write-Offs38,364 50,330 (11,966)(23.8)Operating Expenses105,259 113,658 (8,399)(7.4)579,062 660,999 (81,937)(12.4)OPERATING PROFIT76,078 49,465 26,613 53.8 Interest Expense, Net(8,491)(9,629)1,138 11.8EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAX EXPENSE67,587 39,836 27,751 69.7 INCOME TAX EXPENSE19,554 12,701 6,853 54.0 NET EARNINGS$48,033 $27,135 $20,898 77.0 %RevenuesInformation about our revenues by source and reportable segment is as follows: Three Months Ended March 31, 2023Three Months Ended March 31, 2022(In Thousands)Progressive LeasingViveOtherTotalProgressive LeasingViveOtherTotalLease Revenues and Fees$637,082 $— $— $637,082 $692,914 $— $— $692,914 Interest and Fees on Loans Receivable— 17,153 905 18,058 — 17,116 434 17,550 Total $637,082 $17,153 $905 $655,140 $692,914 $17,116 $434 $710,464 The decrease in Progressive Leasing revenues was primarily due to a 15.4% decrease in consolidated GMV for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to the same period in the prior year, due to tightened lease decisioning in mid-2022, and decreased customer demand for many of the products offered by our POS partners.

The decline in revenues was partially offset by improved customer payment activity in the first quarter of 2023, as compared to the first quarter of 2022.Vive revenues remained relatively flat as compared to the first quarter of 2022 and the growth in Four revenues was primarily driven by strong GMV growth in prior periods.25Operating ExpensesInformation about certain significant components of operating expenses for the first quarter of 2023 as compared to the first quarter of 2022 is as follows: Three Months Ended March 31,Change(In Thousands)20232022$%Personnel Costs1$47,061 $53,585 $(6,524)(12.2)%Stock-Based Compensation5,415 6,623 (1,208)(18.2)Occupancy Costs1,383 1,604 (221)(13.8)Advertising3,322 4,504 (1,182)(26.2)Professional Services4,557 5,455 (898)(16.5)Sales Acquisition Expense27,246 6,093 1,153 18.9 Computer Software Expense36,247 6,596 (349)(5.3)Bank Service Charges2,915 3,430 (515)(15.0)Other Sales, General and Administrative Expense9,663 9,604 59 0.6 Sales, General and Administrative Expense487,809 97,494 (9,685)(9.9)Provision for Loan Losses8,714 7,682 1,032 13.4 Depreciation and Amortization7,979 8,482 (503)(5.9)Restructuring Expense757 — 757 nmfOperating Expenses$105,259 $113,658 $(8,399)(7.4)%nmf—Calculation is not meaningful1 Personnel costs excludes stock-based compensation expense, which is reported separately in the operating expense table.2 Sales acquisition expense includes vendor incentives and rebates to POS partners, external sales commissions, amortization of initial direct costs and amounts paid to various POS partners to be their exclusive provider of lease-to-own solutions.3 Computer software expense consists primarily of software subscription fees, licensing fees and non-capitalizable software implementation costs.4 Progressive Leasing's sales, general and administrative expense was $75.9 million and $85.9 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.The decrease in personnel costs of $6.5 million was driven primarily by a decrease of $7.0 million at Progressive Leasing, attributable to its reduction in the number of employees during the second half of 2022 as part of its restructuring and cost cutting initiatives. Personnel costs attributable to Four and other strategic initiatives also decreased by $0.5 million compared to the same period in 2022. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $0.9 million at Vive.Other Costs and ExpensesDepreciation of lease merchandise. Depreciation of lease merchandise decreased by 12.4% during the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. The decrease was primarily due to the decline in GMV resulting from Progressive Leasing's tightening of its decisioning in mid-2022. As a percentage of total lease revenues and fees, depreciation of lease merchandise decreased to 68.3% from 71.7% in the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower early buyouts in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022.Provision for lease merchandise write-offs. The provision for lease merchandise write-offs decreased $12.0 million due to a decrease in the size of Progressive Leasing's lease portfolio during the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. The provision for lease merchandise write-offs also decreased due to the improved customer payment activity and lower write-offs following Progressive Leasing's tightening of its decisioning in mid-2022, as compared to the higher customer delinquencies and write-offs experienced in the first quarter of 2022. Given the significant economic uncertainty resulting from the rate of the increase in inflation, rising interest rates, the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the potential effects of such developments on Progressive Leasing's POS partners, customers, and business going forward, a high level of estimation was involved in determining the allowance as of March 31, 2023. Actual lease merchandise write-offs could differ materially from the allowance for those write-offs.The provision for lease merchandise write-offs as a percentage of lease revenues decreased to 6.0% during the three months ended March 31, 2023 from 7.3% in the same period in 2022. The decrease in the provision was a result of improved customer payment activity and lower write-offs due to the Company tightening its lease decisioning in mid-2022.26Earnings Before Income Tax ExpenseInformation about our earnings before income tax expense by reportable segment is as follows: Three Months Ended March 31,Change(In Thousands)20232022$%EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAX EXPENSE:Progressive Leasing$71,051 $42,081 $28,970 68.8 %Vive2,163 4,423 (2,260)(51.1)Other(5,627)(6,668)1,041 15.6 Total Earnings Before Income Tax Expense$67,587 $39,836 $27,751 69.7 %The loss before income tax expense within ""Other"" primarily relates to our Four operations. Factors impacting the change in earnings before income taxes are discussed above.Income Tax Expense Income tax expense increased to $19.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to $12.7 million in the prior year comparable period due to higher earnings before income taxes. The effective income tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was 28.9% compared to 31.9% for the same period in 2022. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by favorable changes in discrete tax expense related to stock-based compensation and uncertain tax position liabilities.27Overview of Financial PositionThe major changes in the condensed consolidated balance sheet from December 31, 2022 to March 31, 2023 include: •Cash and cash equivalents increased $118.0 million to $249.8 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023. For additional information, refer to the ""Liquidity and Capital Resources"" section below. •Lease merchandise, net of accumulated depreciation and allowances, decreased $76.4 million due primarily to a 22.6% decrease in Progressive Leasing's GMV for the first quarter of 2023 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022.•Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased $17.4 million primarily due to a $21.5 million increase to income taxes payable as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022.28Liquidity and Capital ResourcesGeneralWe expect that our primary capital requirements will consist of:•Reinvesting in our business, including buying merchandise for the operations of Progressive Leasing. Because we believe Progressive Leasing will continue to grow over the long-term, we expect that the need for additional lease merchandise will remain a major capital requirement; •Making merger and acquisition investment(s) to further broaden our product offerings; and•Returning excess cash to shareholders through periodically repurchasing stock.Other capital requirements include (i) expenditures related to software development; (ii) expenditures related to our corporate operating activities; (iii) personnel expenditures; (iv) income tax payments; (v) funding of loans receivable for Vive; and (vi) servicing our outstanding debt obligation. Our capital requirements have been financed through:•cash flows from operations;•private debt offerings;•bank debt; and•stock offerings.As of March 31, 2023, the Company had $249.8 million of cash, $350.0 million of availability under the Revolving Facility, and $600.0 million of indebtedness.Cash Provided by Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities was $157.4 million and $98.3 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The $59.1 million increase in operating cash flows was primarily driven by the $20.9 million increase in net earnings and a $80.8 million decrease in purchases of lease merchandise compared to the same period in 2022. Changes in certain working capital accounts also contributed to operating cash inflows. Other changes in cash provided by operating activities are discussed above in our discussion of results for the three months ended March 31, 2023.Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $0.6 million and $5.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The $5.0 million decrease in investing cash outflows was primarily the result of a $5.1 million increase in proceeds from loans receivable, while the corresponding increase in cash outflows for investments in loans receivable was $0.7 million.Cash Used in Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities was $38.9 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to $78.9 million during the same period in 2022. Cash used in financing activities in the three months ended March 31, 2023 was primarily for the Company's repurchase of $36.5 million of its common stock, compared to $78.1 million of share repurchases in the same period in the prior year.29Share RepurchasesWe purchase our stock in the market from time to time as authorized by our Board of Directors. On November 3, 2021, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program that replaced the previous $300 million repurchase program. The Company repurchased 1,458,649 shares for $36.5 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023. That amount does not include any excise tax that may be assessed on those repurchases. As of March 31, 2023, we had the authority to purchase additional shares up to our remaining authorization limit of $300.8 million.Debt FinancingOn November 24, 2020, the Company entered into a credit agreement with a consortium of lenders providing for a $350.0 million senior revolving credit facility, under which revolving borrowings became available on the date of the completion of the separation and distribution transaction pursuant to which our former Aaron's Business segment was spun-off into a separate publicly-traded company, and under which all borrowings and commitments will mature or terminate on November 24, 2025.As of March 31, 2023, the Company had no outstanding balance and $350.0 million remaining available for borrowings on the Revolving Facility. The Revolving Facility includes an uncommitted incremental facility increase option (""Incremental Facilities"") which, subject to certain terms and conditions, permits the Company at any time prior to the maturity date to request an increase in extensions of credit available thereunder by an aggregate additional principal amount of up to $300.0 million. Our Revolving Facility contains certain financial covenants, which include requirements that the Company maintain ratios of (i) total net debt to EBITDA of no more than 2.50:1.00 and (ii) consolidated interest coverage of no less than 3.00:1.00. The Company will be in default under the Revolving Facility if it fails to comply with these covenants, and all borrowings outstanding may become due immediately. Additionally, under the Revolving Facility, if the total net debt to EBITDA, as defined by the Revolving Facility, exceeds 1.25, the revolver becomes fully secured for the remaining duration of the Revolving Facility term. As of June 30, 2022, the Company exceeded the 1.25 total net debt to EBITDA ratio and the Revolving Facility became fully secured. At March 31, 2023, we were in compliance with the financial covenants set forth in the Revolving Facility and believe that we will continue to be in compliance in the future.On November 26, 2021, the Company entered into an indenture in connection with its offering of $600 million aggregate principal amount of its senior unsecured notes due 2029 (the ""Senior Notes""). The Senior Notes were issued at 100.0% of their par value with a stated fixed annual interest rate of 6.00%. Interest accrues on the outstanding balance and is payable semi-annually. The Senior Notes are general unsecured obligations of the Company and are guaranteed by certain of the Company's existing and future domestic subsidiaries. The indenture discussed above contains various other covenants and obligations to which the Company and its subsidiaries are subject while the Senior Notes are outstanding. The covenants in the indenture may limit the extent to which, or the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to, among other things: (i) incur additional debt and guarantee debt; (ii) pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem capital stock; (iii) prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt; (iv) issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities; (v) make loans and investments; (vi) sell assets; (vii) incur liens; (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates; (ix) enter into agreements restricting the ability of the Company’s subsidiaries to pay dividends; and (x) consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of the Company’s assets. The indenture also contains customary events of default for transactions of this type and amount. We were in compliance with these covenants at March 31, 2023 and believe that we will continue to be in compliance in the future. CommitmentsIncome TaxesDuring the three months ended March 31, 2023, we made net tax payments of $2.5 million. Within the next nine months, we anticipate making estimated tax payments of $73.7 million for United States federal income taxes and state income taxes. Deferred income tax liabilities as of March 31, 2023 were $126.9 million. Deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their respective book basis, which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the liabilities are settled at their reported financial statement amounts. The results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods.30LeasesWe lease management and information technology space for corporate functions as well as call center space and storage space for our hub facilities under operating leases expiring at various times through 2027. Our corporate and call center leases contain renewal options for additional periods ranging from three to five years. We also lease transportation vehicles under operating leases which generally expire during the next three years. We expect that most leases will be renewed or replaced by other leases in the normal course of business. Contractual Obligations and CommitmentsFuture interest payments on the Company's variable-rate debt are based on a rate per annum equal to, at our option, (i) the London Interbank Overnight Rate (""LIBOR"") plus a margin within the range of 1.5% to 2.5% for revolving loans, based on total leverage, or (ii) the administrative agent's base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.5% to 1.5%, as specified in the agreement. Future interest payments related to our Revolving Facility are based on the borrowings outstanding at that time. Future interest payments may be different depending on future borrowing activity and interest rates. The Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Facility as of March 31, 2023.On November 26, 2021, the Company issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes that bear a fixed annual interest rate of 6.00%. Interest accrues on the outstanding balance and is payable semi-annually. The Senior Notes will mature on November 15, 2029.The Company has no long-term commitments to purchase merchandise nor does it have significant purchase agreements that specify minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months.Unfunded Lending CommitmentsThe Company, through its Vive business, had unconditionally cancellable unfunded lending commitments totaling approximately $521.9 million and $513.7 million as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, that do not give rise to revenues and cash flows. These unfunded commitments arise in the ordinary course of business from credit card agreements with individual cardholders that give them the ability to borrow, against unused amounts, up to the maximum credit limit assigned to their account. While these unfunded amounts represented the total available unused lines of credit, the Company does not anticipate that all cardholders will utilize their entire available line at any given point in time. Commitments to extend unsecured credit are agreements to lend to a cardholder so long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.Critical Accounting PoliciesRefer to the 2022 Annual Report.Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements, including pronouncements that were adopted in the current year.",34124,mgmt,20230426,2023,10Q,real_textdata_2023

We caution the reader that these risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risks and uncertainties, nor can it assess the extent to which any of the risk factors below or any such new risks and uncertainties, or any combination thereof, may impact our business. These risks are more fully described in Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors. These risks include, among others, the following:Risks Related to our Business and Industry•Downturns in economic conditions could adversely affect our business. •We will need to obtain sufficient financing or other capital to operate successfully.•Our high level of debt and other obligations may limit our ability to fund general corporate requirements and obtain additional financing, may limit our flexibility in responding to competitive developments and may cause our business to be vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions.•We have significant pension and other postretirement benefit funding obligations, which may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.•If our financial condition worsens, provisions in our credit card processing and other commercial agreements may adversely affect our liquidity.•The loss of key personnel upon whom we depend to operate our business or the inability to attract and develop additional qualified personnel could adversely affect our business.•Our business has been and will continue to be affected by many changing economic and other conditions beyond our control, including global events that affect travel behavior, and our results of operations could be volatile and fluctuate due to seasonality. •Union disputes, employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions, or our inability to otherwise maintain labor costs at competitive levels and hire and retain a sufficient number of employees may adversely affect our operations and financial performance.•If we encounter problems with any of our third-party regional operators or third-party service providers, our operations could be adversely affected by a resulting decline in revenue or negative public perception about our services.•Any damage to our reputation or brand image could adversely affect our business or financial results.•Changes to our business model that are designed to increase revenues may not be successful and may cause operational difficulties or decreased demand.•Our intellectual property rights, particularly our branding rights, are valuable, and any inability to protect them may adversely affect our business and financial results.•We may be a party to litigation in the normal course of business or otherwise, which could affect our financial position and liquidity.•Our ability to utilize our NOLs and other carryforwards may be limited.3Table of Contents•We have a significant amount of goodwill, which is assessed for impairment at least annually. In addition, we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets or long-lived assets, causing us to record material impairment charges.•The airline industry is intensely competitive and dynamic.•The commercial relationships that we have with other companies, including any related equity investments, may not produce the returns or results we expect.•Our business is very dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Continued periods of high volatility in fuel costs, increased fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a significant negative impact on consumer demand, our operating results and liquidity.•Our business is subject to extensive government regulation, which may result in increases in our costs, disruptions to our operations, limits on our operating flexibility, reductions in the demand for air travel, and competitive disadvantages.•We operate a global business with international operations that are subject to economic and political instability and have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by numerous events, circumstances or government actions beyond our control.•We may be adversely affected by conflicts overseas or terrorist attacks; the travel industry continues to face ongoing security concerns.•We are subject to risks associated with climate change, including increased regulation of our CO2 emissions, changing consumer preferences and the potential increased impacts of severe weather events on our operations and infrastructure.•A shortage of pilots or other personnel has in the past and could continue to materially adversely affect our business.•We depend on a limited number of suppliers for aircraft, aircraft engines and parts.•Delays in scheduled aircraft deliveries or other loss of anticipated fleet capacity, and failure of new aircraft to perform as expected, may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.•We rely heavily on technology and automated systems to operate our business, and any failure of these technologies or systems could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.•Evolving data security and privacy requirements (in particular, compliance with applicable federal, state and foreign laws relating to handling of personal information about individuals) could increase our costs, and any significant data security or privacy incident could disrupt our operations, harm our reputation, expose us to legal risks and otherwise materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.•We rely on third-party distribution channels and must manage effectively the costs, rights and functionality of these channels.•If we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate facilities and infrastructure throughout our system and, at some airports, adequate slots, we may be unable to operate our existing flight schedule and to expand or change our route network in the future, which may have a material adverse impact on our operations.4Table of Contents ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSBelow are certain risk factors that may affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, or the trading price of our common stock or other securities. We caution the reader that these risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risks and uncertainties, nor can it assess the extent to which any of the risk factors below or any such new risks and uncertainties, or any combination thereof, may impact our business.Risks Related to our Business and IndustryDownturns in economic conditions could adversely affect our business.Due to the discretionary nature of business and leisure travel spending and the highly competitive nature of the airline industry, our revenues are heavily influenced by the condition of the U.S. economy and economies in other regions of the world. Unfavorable conditions in these broader economies have resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased passenger demand for air travel, changes in booking practices and related reactions by our competitors, all of which in turn have had, and may have in the future, a strong negative effect on our business. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic and associated decline in economic activity and increase in unemployment levels had a severe and prolonged effect on the global economy generally and, in turn, resulted in a prolonged period of depressed demand for air travel. In addition, a rapid economic expansion following the height of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant inflationary pressures and volatility in certain currencies, which have increased our costs for aircraft fuel, wages and benefits and other goods and services we require to operate our business, as well as increasing the interest expense on our variable-rate indebtedness. We will need to obtain sufficient financing or other capital to operate successfully.Our business plan contemplates continued significant investments related to our fleet, improving the experience of our customers and updating our facilities. Significant capital resources will be required to execute this plan. We estimate that, based on our commitments as of March 31, 2023, our planned aggregate expenditures for aircraft purchase commitments and certain engines on a consolidated basis for the remainder of 2023 through 2027 would be approximately $12.2 billion. We may also require financing to refinance maturing obligations and to provide liquidity to fund other corporate requirements. Accordingly, we will need substantial liquidity, financing or other capital resources to finance such aircraft and engines and meet such other liquidity needs. If needed, it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all, due to, among other factors: our substantial level of existing indebtedness, particularly following the additional liquidity transactions completed in response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; our non-investment grade credit rating; volatile or otherwise unfavorable market conditions; and the availability of assets to use as collateral for loans or other indebtedness, which has been reduced significantly as a result of certain financing transactions we have undertaken since the beginning of 2020 and may be further reduced. If we are unable to arrange any such required financing at customary advance rates and on terms and conditions acceptable to us, we may need to use cash from operations or cash on hand to purchase aircraft and engines or fund our other corporate requirements, or may seek to negotiate deferrals for such aircraft and engines with the applicable manufacturers or otherwise defer corporate obligations. Depending on numerous factors applicable at the time we seek capital, many of which are out of our control, such as the state of the domestic and global economies, the capital and credit markets’ view of our prospects and the airline industry in general, and the general availability of debt and equity capital, the financing or other capital resources that we will need may not be available to us, or may be available only on onerous terms and conditions. Furthermore, we hold significant balances of cash and short-term investments, including as necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations, some of which are held in deposit accounts at commercial banks in excess of the government-provided deposit insurance. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining financing or other needed sources of capital to operate successfully or to fund our committed expenditures. An inability to obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms would limit our ability to execute necessary capital projects and would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.54Table of ContentsOur high level of debt and other obligations may limit our ability to fund general corporate requirements and obtain additional financing, may limit our flexibility in responding to competitive developments and may cause our business to be vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions.We have significant amounts of indebtedness and other financial obligations, including pension obligations, obligations to make future payments on flight equipment and property leases related to airport and other facilities, and substantial non-cancelable obligations under aircraft and related spare engine purchase agreements. Moreover, currently a very significant portion of our assets are pledged to secure our indebtedness. Our substantial indebtedness and other obligations, which are generally greater than the indebtedness and other obligations of our competitors, could have important consequences. For example, they may:•make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness;•limit our ability to obtain additional funding for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments and general corporate purposes, and adversely affect the terms on which such funding can be obtained;•require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our liquidity or cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness and other obligations, thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes;•make us more vulnerable to economic downturns, industry conditions and catastrophic external events, particularly relative to competitors with lower relative levels of financial leverage;•significantly constrain our ability to respond, or respond quickly, to unexpected disruptions in our own operations, the U.S. or global economies, or the businesses in which we operate, or to take advantage of opportunities that would improve our business, operations, or competitive position versus other airlines;•limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions;•bear interest at floating rates, subjecting us to volatility in interest expenses as interest rates fluctuate;•contain covenants requiring us to maintain an aggregate of at least $2.0 billion of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and amounts available to be drawn under revolving credit facilities and collateral coverage ratios and peak debt service coverage ratios; and•contain restrictive covenants that could, among other things:◦limit our ability to merge, consolidate, sell assets, incur additional indebtedness, issue preferred stock, make investments and pay dividends; and◦if breached, result in an event of default under our indebtedness.In addition, during the COVID-19 pandemic we were required to obtain a significant amount of additional financing from a variety of sources and we cannot guarantee that we will not need to obtain additional financing in the future. Such financing may include the issuance of additional unsecured or secured debt securities, equity securities and equity-linked securities as well as additional bilateral and syndicated secured and/or unsecured credit facilities, among other items. There can be no assurance as to the timing of any such financing transactions, which may be in the near term, or that we will be able to obtain such additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. Any such actions may be material in nature, could result in the incurrence and issuance of significant additional indebtedness or equity and could impose significant covenants and restrictions to which we are not currently subject. Moreover, as a result of the financing activities we undertook in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of financings with respect to which such covenants and provisions apply has increased, thereby subjecting us to more substantial risk of cross-default and cross-acceleration in the event of breach, and additional covenants and provisions could become binding on us as we continue to seek additional liquidity. The obligations discussed above, including those imposed as a result of any additional financings we may be required to undertake, could also impact our ability to obtain additional financing, if needed, and our flexibility in the conduct of our business, and could materially adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.Further, a substantial amount of our long-term indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating interest rates, primarily based on LIBOR for deposits of U.S. dollars. LIBOR tends to fluctuate based on general short-term interest rates, rates set by 55Table of Contentsthe U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks, the supply of and demand for credit in the London interbank market and general economic conditions. We have not hedged our interest rate exposure with respect to our floating rate debt. Accordingly, our interest expense for any particular period will fluctuate based on LIBOR and other variable interest rates. In 2022 and continuing into 2023, in response to rising inflation which coincided with a rapid rebound of economic activity as governments lifted restrictions and economies reopened following the COVID-19 pandemic, central banks around the world—including the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England—commenced a cycle of raising interest rates, which has consequently increased the interest we pay on our floating-rate indebtedness. To the extent the interest rates applicable to our floating rate debt increase, our interest expense will increase, in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs, and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected. On July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced its intention to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The discontinuation date for submission and publication of rates for certain tenors of USD LIBOR (1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month) was subsequently extended by the ICE Benchmark Administration (the administrator of LIBOR) until June 30, 2023. It is not possible to predict what rate or rates may become the predominant alternative to LIBOR, or what effect these changes in views or alternatives may have on financial markets for LIBOR-linked financial instruments. While the U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, has chosen SOFR, and specifically Term SOFR, as the recommended risk-free reference rate for the U.S. (calculated based on repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities), we cannot currently predict the extent to which this index will gain widespread acceptance as a replacement for LIBOR. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the United Kingdom, the United States or elsewhere. See also the discussion of interest rate risk in Part I, Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – “Interest.”As of March 31, 2023, we had $5.3 billion of borrowings with interest rates linked to LIBOR. We have commenced the process of amending our LIBOR-based financing agreements to transition them to successor reference rates in anticipation of LIBOR’s discontinuation, but we may not be able to reach agreements with all affected counterparties, or to do so on favorable terms. Additionally, the replacement of LIBOR with a comparable or successor rate could cause the amount of interest payable on our long-term debt to be different or higher than expected.We have significant pension and other postretirement benefit funding obligations, which may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.Our pension funding obligations are significant. The amount of our pension funding obligations will depend on the performance of investments held in trust by the pension plans, interest rates for determining liabilities and actuarial experience. We also have significant obligations for retiree medical and other postretirement benefits. Additionally, we participate in the IAM National Pension Fund (the IAM Pension Fund). The funding status of the IAM Pension Fund is subject to the risk that other employers may not meet their obligations, which under certain circumstances could cause our obligations to increase. On March 29, 2019, the actuary for the IAM Pension Fund certified that the fund was in “endangered” status despite reporting a funded status of over 80%. Additionally, the IAM Pension Fund’s Board voluntarily elected to enter into “critical” status on April 17, 2019. Upon entry into critical status, the IAM Pension Fund was required by law to adopt a rehabilitation plan aimed at restoring the financial health of the pension plan and did so on April 17, 2019 (the Rehabilitation Plan). Under the Rehabilitation Plan, American was subject to an immaterial contribution surcharge, which ceased to apply June 14, 2019 upon American’s mandatory adoption of a contribution schedule under the Rehabilitation Plan. The contribution schedule requires 2.5% annual increases to its contribution rate. This contribution schedule will remain in effect through the earlier of December 31, 2031 or the date the IAM Pension Fund emerges from critical status. Furthermore, if we were to withdraw from the IAM Pension Fund, if the IAM Pension fund were to terminate, or if the IAM Pension Fund were to undergo a mass withdrawal, we could be subject to liability as imposed by law.If our financial condition worsens, provisions in our credit card processing and other commercial agreements may adversely affect our liquidity.We have agreements with companies that process customer credit card transactions for the sale of air travel and other services. These agreements allow these credit card processing companies, under certain conditions (including, with respect to certain agreements, our failure to maintain certain levels of liquidity), to hold an amount of our cash (referred to as a holdback) equal to some or all of the advance ticket sales that have been processed by that credit card processor, but for which we have not yet provided the air transportation. Additionally, such credit card processing companies may 56Table of Contentsrequire cash or other collateral reserves to be established. These credit card processing companies are not currently entitled to maintain any holdbacks pursuant to these requirements. These holdback requirements can be implemented at the discretion of the credit card processing companies upon the occurrence of specific events, including material adverse changes in our financial condition or the triggering of a liquidity covenant. The imposition of holdback requirements, up to and including 100% of relevant advanced ticket sales, would materially reduce our liquidity. Likewise, other of our commercial agreements contain provisions that allow other counterparties to impose less-favorable terms, including the acceleration of amounts due, in the event of material adverse changes in our financial condition. For example, we maintain certain letters of credit, insurance- and surety-related agreements under which counterparties may require collateral, including cash collateral.The loss of key personnel upon whom we depend to operate our business or the inability to attract and develop additional qualified personnel could adversely affect our business.We believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to attract, develop and retain highly qualified management, technical and other personnel. Retaining and recruiting people with the appropriate skills is particularly challenging as the economy in general, and the airline industry in particular, continue to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in competition for the human resources necessary to operate our business successfully. We may not be successful in attracting, developing or retaining key personnel or other highly qualified personnel. In addition, competition for skilled personnel has intensified and may continue to intensify if overall industry capacity continues to increase and/or we were to incur attrition at levels higher than we have historically. Any inability to attract, develop and retain significant numbers of qualified management and other personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our business has been and will continue to be affected by many changing economic and other conditions beyond our control, including global events that affect travel behavior, and our results of operations could be volatile and fluctuate due to seasonality.Our business, results of operations and financial condition have been and will continue to be affected by many changing economic and other conditions beyond our control, including, among others:•actual or potential changes in international, national, regional and local economic, business and financial conditions, including recession, inflation and higher interest rates;•the occurrence of wars, terrorist attacks and political instability;•changes in consumer preferences, perceptions, spending patterns and demographic trends;•changes in the competitive environment due to industry consolidation, changes in airline alliance affiliations and other factors;•actual or potential disruptions to the U.S. National Airspace System (the ATC system);•increases in costs of safety, security and environmental measures;•outbreaks of diseases that affect travel behavior, such as occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic; and•weather and natural disasters, including increases in frequency, severity or duration of such disasters, and related costs caused by more severe weather due to climate change.The COVID-19 pandemic, along with the measures governments and private organizations worldwide implemented in an attempt to contain its spread, resulted in significant volatility in demand for air travel, which adversely affected our business, operations and financial condition to an unprecedented extent and for a prolonged period. Measures implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic—such as travel restrictions, including testing regimes, “stay at home” and quarantine orders, limitations on public gatherings, cancellation of public events and many others—initially resulted in a precipitous decline in demand for both domestic and international business and leisure travel. In response to this material deterioration in demand, we took a number of aggressive actions to ameliorate the impacts to our business, operations and financial condition. While cases have declined globally and many governments have loosened or lifted COVID-related travel restrictions, the potential for a resurgence of COVID-19, including the emergence and spread of any new variants, and its after effects remain uncertain, and there can be no assurance that any mitigating actions we take in response will be sufficient to avert a deterioration in our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated changes in business practices which may persist. For example, businesses and other 57Table of Contentstravelers may continue to forego air travel in favor of remote or flexible working policies and communication alternatives such as videoconferencing. In addition, businesses may seek to reduce travel costs by requiring the purchase of less expensive tickets, thereby potentially impacting our average revenue per available seat mile.In addition to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, an outbreak of another contagious disease—such as has occurred in the past with the Ebola virus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, H1N1 influenza virus, avian flu, Zika virus or any other similar illness—if it were to become associated with air travel or persist for an extended period, could materially affect the airline industry and us by reducing revenues and adversely impacting our operations and passengers’ travel behavior. As a result of these or other conditions beyond our control, our results of operations could be volatile and subject to rapid and unexpected change. In addition, due to generally weaker demand for air travel during the winter, our revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year could be weaker than revenues in the second and third quarters of the year.Union disputes, employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions, or our inability to otherwise maintain labor costs at competitive levels and hire and retain a sufficient number of employees may adversely affect our operations and financial performance.Relations between air carriers and labor unions in the U.S. are governed by the Railway Labor Act (RLA). Under the RLA, collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) generally contain “amendable dates” rather than expiration dates, and the RLA requires that a carrier maintain the existing terms and conditions of employment following the amendable date through a multi-stage and usually lengthy series of bargaining processes overseen by the National Mediation Board (NMB). As of December 31, 2022, approximately 87% of our employees were represented for collective bargaining purposes by labor unions, and 48% were covered by CBAs that are currently amendable or that will become amendable within one year. For the dates that the CBAs with our major work groups become amendable under the RLA, see “Labor Relations” under",29891,rf,20230427,2023,10Q,real_textdata_2023

Market Pressures The senior management team monitors and manages the Company’s ability to operate effectively as the result of market pressures. In particular, we are currently experiencing challenges in obtaining certain raw materials and labor on a timely basis at a reasonable cost. We expect these supply chain challenges and cost impacts to continue for the foreseeable future. Although we have secured additional raw materials from existing and alternate suppliers and have taken other mitigating actions to mitigate supply disruptions, we cannot guarantee that we can continue to do so in the future. In this event, our business, results and financial condition could be adversely affected. Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). These GAAP financial statements include certain charges the Company believes are not indicative of its core ongoing operational performance. As a result, the Company provides financial information in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis that was not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to the information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company provides this non-GAAP financial information because the Company’s management utilizes it to evaluate its ongoing financial performance and the Company believes it provides greater transparency to investors as supplemental information to its GAAP results. The Company has provided the non-GAAP financial measures of non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin as a result of items that the Company believes are not indicative of its ongoing operations. These include transactions associated with the Company’s acquisitions and the items described below in “Consolidated Results.” The Company believes that evaluation of its financial performance compared with prior and future periods can be enhanced by a presentation of results that exclude the impact of these items. The Company has incurred substantial expense and income associated with acquisitions. While the Company cannot predict the exact timing or amounts of such charges, it does expect to treat the financial impact of these transactions as special items in its future presentation of non-GAAP results. Results of Operations Consolidated Results Our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 are as follows: 19 Three months ended March 31, (in millions, except ratios) 2023 2022 Net sales $ 112.6 $ 92.4 Cost of sales 77.7 66.0 Gross profit $ 34.9 $ 26.4 Percent of sales 31.0 % 28.6 % Selling and administrative expenses 27.2 18.6 Percent of sales 24.2 % 20.1 % Amortization and earnout expenses 1.7 1.5 Acquisition and integration expenses 0.5 1.0 Restructuring expenses — 0.1 Operating income $ 5.5 $ 5.2 Operating margin 4.9 % 5.6 % To compare operating performance between the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company has adjusted GAAP operating income to exclude (1) amortization of intangible assets, earnout and retention expenses, (2) acquisition and integration expenses, which include legal, accounting, and other expenses, and (3) restructuring expenses primarily relating to severance, facility exits, and associated legal expenses. The following table presents the reconciliation of GAAP operating income and GAAP operating margin to non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin: Three months ended March 31, (in millions, except ratios) 2023 2022 Operating income as reported in accordance with GAAP $ 5.5 $ 5.2 Operating margin in accordance with GAAP 4.9 % 5.6 % Amortization and earnout expenses 1.7 1.5 Acquisition and integration expenses 0.5 1.0 Restructuring expenses — 0.1 Non-GAAP operating income $ 7.7 $ 7.8 Non-GAAP operating margin 6.8 % 8.4 % Orders booked decreased $14.8 million, or 9.2%, to $146.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared with a record $160.9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2022. The decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease of $31.7 million in our emissions management technologies, partially offset by increases of $18.2 million in our engineered cyclone systems. Of the $146.1 million orders during the three months ended March 31, 2023, $23.4 million is attributable to prior and current year acquisitions. Net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2023 increased $20.2 million, or 21.9%, to $112.6 million compared with $92.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The increase is led by increases of $12.6 million in our separation, filtration, and industrial water technologies and $8.0 million in our thermal acoustics technologies. Approximately 40%, or $8.3 million, of the increase in net sales is attributable to organic revenue growth, while $11.9 million is attributable to prior and current year acquisitions. Gross profit increased $8.5 million, or 32.2%, to $34.9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared with $26.4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2022. The increase in gross profit is primarily attributable to the increase in sales volume as described above, higher project margin mix and acquisitions of businesses with favorable margins. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 31.0% in the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared with 28.6% in the three months ended March 31, 2022. Selling and administrative expenses were $27.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared with $18.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The increase is primarily attributable to acquisitions during the prior and current year, a $2.5 million favorable insurance settlement in the prior year, and increased headcount in order to support our revenue growth and global footprint. Amortization and earnout expense was $1.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared with $1.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The increase in expense is attributable to a $0.2 million increase in definite lived asset amortization due to increased intangible assets attributable to current and prior year acquisitions. 20 Operating income increased $0.3 million to $5.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared with operating income of $5.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The increase in operating income is primarily attributable to increases in net sales. Non-GAAP operating income was $7.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared with $7.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of sales decreased to 6.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 from 8.4% for the three months ended March 31, 2022. Interest expense increased to $2.4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared with interest expense of $0.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to increased debt balances and rising interest rates. Income tax expense was zero for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared with income tax expense of $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The effective income tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was 0.4% compared with 28.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The effective income tax rates for the three months ended March 31, 2023 differ from the United States federal statutory rate. Our effective tax rate is affected by certain other permanent differences, including state income taxes, non-deductible incentive stock-based compensation, and differences in tax rates among the jurisdictions in which we operate. Business Segments The Company’s operations are organized and reviewed by management along its product lines or end market that the segment serves and are presented in two reportable segments. The results of the segments are reviewed through “Income from operations” on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Three months ended March 31, (in thousands) 2023 2022 Net Sales (less intra- and inter-segment sales) Engineered Systems segment $ 74,454 $ 56,975 Industrial Process Solutions segment 38,109 35,461 Total net sales $ 112,563 $ 92,436 Three months ended March 31, (in thousands) 2023 2022 Income from Operations Engineered Systems segment $ 9,805 $ 6,470 Industrial Process Solutions segment 5,546 4,139 Corporate and Other(1) (9,890 ) (5,407 ) Total income from operations $ 5,461 $ 5,202 (1) Includes corporate compensation, professional services, information technology and other general and administrative corporate expenses. Engineered Systems Segment Our Engineered Systems segment net sales increased $17.5 million to $74.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared with $57.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The increase is led by increases of $12.6 million in separation, filtration, and industrial water technologies and $8.0 million in our thermal acoustics technologies. Approximately 40%, or $6.6 million, of the increase in net sales is attributable to organic revenue growth, while $10.9 million is attributable to prior and current year acquisitions. Operating income for the Engineered Systems segment increased $3.3 million to $9.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared with $6.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The operating income increase is primarily attributable to higher gross profit related to increased sales of $17.5 million, partially offset by an increase of $4.2 million in selling and administrative expense. 21 Industrial Process Solutions Segment Our Industrial Process Solutions segment net sales increased $2.6 million to $38.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared with $35.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The increase is primarily attributable to increases across all products serving industrial air end markets. Approximately 60%, or $1.6 million, of the increase in net sales is attributable to organic revenue growth, while $1.0 million is attributable to prior year acquisitions. Operating income for the Industrial Process Solutions segment increased $1.4 million to $5.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared with $4.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The increase is primarily attributable to higher gross profit related to increased sales of $2.6 million, offset by an increase of $0.7 million in selling and administrative expense. Corporate and Other Segment Operating expense for the Corporate and Other segment increased $4.5 million to $9.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared with $5.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The increase is primarily attributable to investments made to support growth, inflationary increases for wages and services, and a favorable insurance settlement of $2.5 million in the prior year period. Backlog Backlog (i.e., unfulfilled or remaining performance obligations) represents the sales we expect to recognize for our products and services for which control has not yet transferred to the customer. Backlog increased to $356.1 million as of March 31, 2023, inclusive of $10.8 million from current year acquisitions, from $311.7 million as of December 31, 2022. Our customers may have the right to cancel a given order. Historically, cancellations have not been common. Backlog is adjusted on a quarterly basis for adjustments in foreign currency exchange rates. Substantially all backlog is expected to be delivered within 12 to 18 months. Backlog is not defined by GAAP and our methodology for calculating backlog may not be consistent with methodologies used by other companies.

REAL_1004_01_rf_2023_0013,1004,01,1004:01,"Item 1A.Risk Factors9​​​ ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSThe following is a description of the principal risks inherent in our business. Any of the risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and should be considered in evaluating us. Although the risks are organized by heading, and each risk is described separately, many of the risks are interrelated. While we believe we have identified and discussed below the material risks affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we do not currently believe to be material that may adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations in the future.Risks Related to Our Business and IndustryWe are affected by factors that adversely impact the commercial aviation industry.As a provider of products and services to the commercial aviation industry, we are greatly affected by overall economic conditions of that industry. The commercial aviation industry is historically cyclical and has been negatively affected in the past by geopolitical events, conflicts and wars, weather related events, natural disasters, pandemics, disruption to fuel and oil production and supply shortages, high fuel and oil prices, environmental concerns (including climate change), lack of capital, cost inflation, and weak economic conditions. As a result of these and other events, from time to time certain of our customers have filed for bankruptcy protection or ceased operation. The impact of instability in the global financial markets may lead airlines to reduce domestic or international capacity. In addition, certain of our airline customers have in the past been impacted by tight credit markets, which limited their ability to buy parts, services, engines, and aircraft. 9 Table of ContentsA reduction in the operating fleet of aircraft both in the U.S. and abroad will result in reduced demand for parts support and maintenance activities for the type of aircraft affected. A deteriorating airline environment may also result in our inability to fully collect outstanding accounts receivable, which we experienced during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021. Reduced demand from customers caused by weak economic conditions, including tight credit conditions and customer bankruptcies, may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.In addition, an increase in energy costs and the price of fuel to the airlines could result in additional pressure on the operating costs of airlines, who comprise our largest customers. The market for jet fuel is inherently volatile and is subject to, among other things, changes in government policy on jet fuel production, fluctuations in the global supply of crude oil and disruptions in oil production or delivery caused by hostility in oil-producing areas. Airlines are sometimes unable to pass on increases in fuel prices to customers by increasing fares due to the competitive nature of the airline industry, and this compounds the pressure on operating costs, and in turn, airlines’ ability to do business with us. In addition, our business depends on maintaining a sufficient supply of various products to meet our customers’ demands. If we were to lose a key supplier, or were unable to obtain the same levels of deliveries from these suppliers and were unable to supplement those purchases with products obtained from other suppliers, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, our key suppliers could also increase the pricing of their products, which would negatively affect our operating results if we were not able to pass these price increases through to our customers.Our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth rates have been and may continue to be adversely affected by these and other events that impact the aviation industry, including the following:●deterioration in the financial condition of our existing and potential customers;●reductions in the need for, or the deferral of, aircraft maintenance and repair services and spare parts support;●retirement of older generation aircraft, resulting in lower prices for spare parts and services for those aircraft;●reductions in demand for used aircraft and engines;●increased in-house maintenance by airlines;●lack of parts in the marketplace;●acts of terrorism;●economic sanctions;●inflationary pressures and conditions;●political, social and economic instability and disruptions;●cost of labor shortages and other changes in labor conditions;●future outbreaks of infectious diseases; and●acts of God.Pandemics and other disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19, and similar public health threats that may arise in the future, may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.While commercial airline traffic recovered significantly from COVID-19 over the last two years, pandemics, disease outbreaks or similar public health threats, continues to pose a range of risks to our business. The emergence of new variants or diseases, developments in the public health situation, the reimposition of regional or global travel restrictions, and other pandemic-related complications could have a negative impact on our business. 10 Table of ContentsReduced numbers of aircraft flying or flight hours negatively impacts the demand for our aftermarket parts support and maintenance services, and any prolonged reduction in the future could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, and liquidity.From the COVID-19 pandemic, some businesses have expanded remote working opportunities and continued to restrict non-essential travel for their employees, which has kept demand for business air travel below pre-pandemic levels. Consumer behavior related to traveling may continue to be negatively impacted by adverse changes in business travel patterns or adverse changes in the perceived or actual economic climate, including declines in income levels and/or loss of wealth resulting from the impact from economic conditions.We are unable to predict the extent to which disease outbreaks or other public health threats that may arise in the future may change air travel, which could have a material impact on our business. The degree to which any future disease outbreaks or public health threats may impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity is uncertain and will depend on future developments.Our U.S. government contracts may not continue at present sales levels, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Our sales to branches, agencies and departments of the U.S. government and their contractors were $577.0 million (29.0% of consolidated sales) in fiscal 2023 (See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The majority of our U.S. government sales is for products and services supporting DoD aircraft sustainment and mobility strategy and DoS flight operations and are, therefore, subject to changes in defense and other governmental agency funding and spending. Our contracts with the U.S. government and their contractors are typically agreements to provide products and services at a fixed price and have a term of one year or less, frequently subject to extension for one or more additional periods of one year at the option of the government customer. Sales to agencies of the U.S. government and their contractors are subject to a number of factors, including the level of troop and personnel deployment worldwide, competitive bidding, U.S. government funding, requirements generated by world events, and budgetary constraints. For example, in conjunction with the U.S. exit from Afghanistan in fiscal 2022, we concluded our activities in country under our DoS and DoD contracts. U.S. government programs are subject to annual congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes. In recent years, U.S. government appropriations have been affected by larger U.S. government budgetary issues and related legislation, including the statutory limit on the amount of permissible federal debt. These issues could negatively affect the timely collection of our U.S. government invoices.Future congressional appropriation and authorization of defense spending and the application of sequestration remain marked by significant debate and an uncertain schedule. The federal debt limit continues to be actively debated as plans for long-term national fiscal policy are discussed. The outcome of these debates could have a significant impact on defense spending broadly and programs we support in particular.If there are funding delays and constraints, we may be required to continue to perform for some period of time on certain of our U.S. government contracts even if the U.S. government is unable to make timely payments. Future budget cuts, including cuts mandated by sequestration, or future procurement decisions could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays of existing contracts or programs which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, U.S. government programs budgets could be negatively impacted by possible policy changes on defense spending, spending priorities outside defense, reduction in military presence overseas and in general pressure to reduce U.S. defense spending. A significant reduction in defense spending could result in a reduction in the amount of our products and services furnished to the U.S. government.We use estimates when accounting for long-term contracts and face risks of cost overruns and losses on these contracts.We sell certain of our products and services to our commercial, government, and defense customers under firm contracts providing for fixed unit prices, regardless of costs incurred by us. The cost of providing products or services may be adversely affected by increases in the cost of labor, materials, fuel, overhead, and other unknown variants, including manufacturing and other operational 11 Table of Contentsinefficiencies and differences between assumptions used by us to price a contract and actual results. Increased costs may result in cost overruns and losses on such contracts, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We recognize revenue on our long-term contracts primarily over time as there is continuous transfer of control to the customer over the duration of the contract as the services are delivered, which generally requires estimates of total costs at completion, fees earned on the contract, or both. This estimation process is complex and involves significant judgment related to assumptions on flight hours, component repair costs, labor hours and rates, and contract penalties and incentives. Adjustments to estimates are often required as work progresses, experience is gained and additional information becomes known, even though the scope of the work required under the contract may not change. Any adjustment as a result of a change in estimates is recognized as events become known. Changes in the underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates could result in adjustments that may adversely affect our future financial results.If our subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform their contractual obligations, our contract profitability and our ability to win new contracts may be adversely affected.We rely on subcontractors to perform a portion of the services we agree to provide our customers, and our suppliers provide necessary inventory and component parts. A failure by one or more of our subcontractors or suppliers to satisfactorily provide on a timely basis the agreed-upon services or supplies may affect our ability to perform our contractual obligations. Deficiencies in the performance of our subcontractors and/or suppliers could result in liquidated damages or our customer terminating our contract for default. A termination for default could expose us to liability and adversely affect our financial performance and our ability to win new contract awards.Success at our airframe maintenance facilities is dependent upon continued outsourcing by the airlines and our ability to maintain our operational footprint.We currently perform airframe maintenance, repair, and overhaul activities at six leased locations. If our maintenance facilities become unavailable either temporarily or permanently due to our inability to extend our leases on commercial reasonable terms, labor disruptions or circumstances beyond our control, such as geopolitical developments or logistical complications arising from acts of war, cyber-attacks, weather, global climate change, earthquakes or other natural disasters including public health crises, we may be unable to shift such work to other facilities or to make up for lost work. Revenues at these facilities fluctuate based on demand for maintenance which, in turn, is driven by the number of aircraft operating and the extent of outsourcing of maintenance activities by airlines. In addition, certain airlines operate certain new fleet types and/or newer generation aircraft and we may not have contractual arrangements to service these aircraft nor technicians trained and certified to perform the required airframe maintenance, repair, and overhaul activities. If either the number of aircraft operating or the level of outsourcing of maintenance activities declines, we may not be able to execute our operational and financial plans at our maintenance, repair, and overhaul facilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Our operations may be adversely affected by a shortage of skilled personnel or work stoppages.Our business has historically been dependent on educated and skilled aviation mechanics because of the complex nature of many of our products and services. We face competition for management and qualified technical personnel from other companies and organizations. Furthermore, we have a collective bargaining agreement covering approximately 200 employees in our Expeditionary Services segment (approximately 5% of our total workforce).Our ability to operate successfully and meet our customers’ demands could be jeopardized if we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of skilled personnel, including aviation mechanics, to conduct our business, or we experience a significant or prolonged work stoppage in such an environment. In such case, our ability to secure new work and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. There is significant competition for such personnel in the industries in which we operate. We may be impacted by higher labor costs and/or labor shortages due to wage and salary inflationary pressures in the economy, a tightening labor market and increased rates of employee resignations generally throughout the U.S. economy.Employees in certain locations have shown increased interest in unionization. If a significant portion of our employees were to become unionized, our labor costs could increase and our business could be negatively affected by other requirements and expectations that could increase our costs, change our employee culture, decrease our flexibility and disrupt our business. Additionally, our responses to any union organizing efforts could negatively impact how we are perceived and have adverse effects on our business, including on our financial results. These responses could also expose us to legal risk, causing us to incur costs to defend legal and regulatory actions, potential penalties and restrictions or reputational harm.12 Table of ContentsWe operate in highly competitive markets, and competitive pressures may adversely affect us.The markets for our products and services to our commercial, government, and defense customers are highly competitive, and we face competition from a number of sources, both domestic and international. Our competitors include aircraft manufacturers, aircraft component and parts manufacturers, airline and aircraft service companies, other companies providing maintenance, repair and overhaul services, other aircraft spare parts distributors and redistributors. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and others may price their products and services below our selling prices. These competitive markets also create pressure on our ability to hire and retain qualified technicians and other skilled labor needs. We believe that our ability to compete depends on superior customer service and support, on-time delivery, sufficient inventory availability, competitive pricing, and effective quality assurance programs.Our government customers, including the DoD and DoS, may turn to commercial contractors, rather than traditional defense contractors, for certain work, or may utilize set asides such as small business, women-owned, or minority-owned contractors or determine to source work internally rather than use us. We are also impacted by bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards and task orders. Bid protests could result in significant expense for us, contract modifications, or the award decision being overturned and loss of the contract award. Even where a bid protest does not result in the loss of an award, the resolution can extend the time until the contract activity can begin, and delay earnings. These competitive pressures, with potential impacts on both our commercial and government business, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We are exposed to risks associated with operating internationally.We conduct our business in a number of foreign countries, some of which are politically unstable or subject to military or civil conflicts. Consequently, we are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including the following:●military conflicts, civil strife, and political risks;●export regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports;●export controls and financial and economic sanctions imposed on certain industry sectors, including the aviation sector, and parties in Russia by the U.S., the U.K., the European Union and others;●compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, United Kingdom (“UK”) Bribery Act 2010, and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws; see Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about certain pending proceedings;●the burden and cost of compliance with foreign laws, treaties, and technical standards and changes in those regulations;●contract award and funding delays;●potential restrictions on transfers of funds;●import and export duties and value added taxes;●foreign exchange risk;●transportation delays and interruptions;●uncertainties arising from foreign local business practices and cultural considerations; and●changes in U.S. policies on trade relations and trade policy, including implementation of or changes in trade sanctions, tariffs, and embargoes.Any measures adopted to reduce the potential impact of losses resulting from the risks of doing business internationally, may not be adequate, and the regions in which we operate might not continue to be stable enough to allow us to operate profitably or at all.13 Table of ContentsAcquisitions expose us to risks, including the risk that we may be unable to effectively integrate acquired businesses.We have completed acquisitions in the past and we have discussions with third parties regarding acquisitions on a regular basis. Acquisitions involve risks, including difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel, the effects of amortization of any acquired intangible assets and the potential impairment of goodwill, and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired business. In addition, acquisitions often require substantial management resources and have the potential to divert our attention from our existing business. For any businesses we may acquire in the future, we may not be able to execute our operational, financial, or integration plans for the acquired businesses, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We may not realize the anticipated benefits of the Trax acquisition, and may face difficulties integrating Trax’s operations.We expect the acquisition of Trax, as a provider of comprehensive MRO and airline fleet management software, to expand our proprietary technology and digital portfolio and accelerate our strategy to offer digital solutions to our customers. However, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the Trax acquisition or our digital solutions strategy, including any synergies, cross-selling opportunities, cost savings or growth opportunities. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. Further, we may not be able to execute our integration plans for Trax and may face diversion of management attention from our existing business, unanticipated costs and risks associated with expanding further into the digital solutions market. Failing to realize the anticipated benefits and difficulties integrating Trax could have a material adverse effect on business, operating results and financial condition.Market values for our aviation products fluctuate and we may be unable to recover our costs incurred on engines, rotable components and other aircraft parts.We make a number of assumptions when determining the recoverability of rotable components, engines, and other assets which are on lease, available for lease, or supporting our long-term programs. These assumptions include historical sales trends, current and expected usage trends, replacement values, current and expected lease rates, residual values, future demand, and future cash flows. Reductions in demand for these assets or declining market values, as well as differences between actual results and the assumptions utilized by us when determining the recoverability of our aircraft, engines, and other assets, could result in impairment charges in future periods, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Our business could be negatively affected by cyber or other security threats or other disruptions.Our business depends heavily on information technology and computerized systems to communicate and operate effectively. We store sensitive data including proprietary business information, intellectual property and confidential employee or other personal data on our servers and databases. Our systems and technologies, or those of third parties on which we rely, could fail or become unreliable due to equipment failures, software viruses, cyber threats, ransomware attacks, terrorist acts, natural disasters, power failures, political or social unrest, pandemics or other public health issues or other causes. These threats arise in some cases as a result of our role as a defense contractor.Cyber security threats are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to our sensitive information, business e-mail compromises, ransomware attacks, and other electronic security breaches, including at our customers, suppliers, subcontractors, and joint venture partners, that could lead to disruptions in mission critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, and corruption of data.14 Table of ContentsA theft, loss, fraudulent use or misuse of customer, stockholder, employee or our proprietary data by cybercrime or otherwise, noncompliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such data or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such data could adversely impact our reputation and could result in costs, fines, litigation or regulatory action against us. Security breaches can create system disruptions and shutdowns that could result in disruptions to our operations. We cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities, new vulnerabilities or other developments will not compromise or breach the security solutions protecting our information technology, networks and systems. A failure of or cyber‐attack on our information systems technology or those of our partners, customers, vendors, or suppliers could adversely affect our ability to process orders, maintain proper levels of inventory, collect accounts receivable and pay expenses; all of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Such serious harm can involve, among other things, misuse of our assets, business disruptions, loss of data, unauthorized access to trade secrets and confidential business information, unauthorized access to personal information, legal claims or proceedings, reporting errors, processing inefficiencies, negative media attention, reputational harm, loss of sales, remediation and increased insurance costs, and interference with regulatory compliance. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience some of these types of cybersecurity threats and incidents, which could be material in the future.The procedures and controls we utilize to monitor and mitigate these threats may not be sufficient to prevent security threats from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, the costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, operating results, and financial condition.Moreover, expenditures incurred in implementing and maintaining cyber security and other procedures and controls could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We may need to make significant capital expenditures to keep pace with technological developments in our industry.The industries in which we participate are constantly undergoing development and change, and it is likely that new products, equipment, and methods of repair and overhaul services will be introduced in the future. We may need to make significant expenditures to purchase new equipment and to train our employees to keep pace with any new technological developments. These expenditures could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Risks Related to Financial MattersWe may need to reduce the carrying value of our assets.We own and distribute a significant amount of engines, aircraft parts and components, as well as own manufacturing facilities and joint venture investments. Recurring losses in certain operations could require us to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of the related assets and recognize an impairment charge through earnings to reduce the carrying value. In addition, if aircraft or engines for which we offer replacement parts or supply repair and overhaul services are retired and there are fewer aircraft that require these parts or services, our revenues may decline.We make a number of assumptions when determining the recoverability of our assets, including historical sales trends, current and expected usage trends, replacement values, current and expected lease rates, residual values, future demand, and future cash flows. Differences between actual results and the assumptions utilized by us when determining the recoverability of our assets could result in impairment charges in future periods, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We have recorded goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions, including $122.3 million associated with our acquisition of Trax in fiscal 2023. If we are unable to achieve the projected levels of operating results, it may be necessary to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and related intangible assets. Similarly, if we were to lose a key customer or if a regulator were to terminate any of our repair certificates at our airframe maintenance or landing gear facilities, we might be required to record an impairment charge if we were unable to operate.We may not be able to fully execute our stock repurchase program and may not otherwise return capital to our stockholders in the foreseeable future.In 2021, we announced a stock repurchase program with authorization to repurchase up to $150 million of our common stock, of which $92.4 million has been repurchased under the program as of May 31, 2023. There is no guarantee as to the exact number of shares or value that will be repurchased under the stock repurchase program and we may discontinue purchases at any time. Whether 15 Table of Contentswe make any further repurchases will depend on many factors, including but not limited to our business and financial performance, the business and market conditions at the time, including the price of our shares, and other factors that management considers relevant. Additionally, we expect to fund repurchases under our stock repurchase program through cash on hand, which may impact our ability to pursue potential strategic opportunities. Although our stock repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program’s effectiveness and there can be no assurance that any stock repurchases will enhance stockholder value.Our credit agreement prohibits payment of a dividend or repurchase of our stock if a default exists under the agreement. In addition, we have not declared a dividend on our common stock since 2020, and there can be no assurance that we will do so in the foreseeable future. The declaration and payment of cash dividends is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be dependent upon our future earnings, cash flows, financial condition, capital requirements and strategy and any future government restrictions. If we do not pay dividends or continue to execute on our stock repurchase program, investors will have to rely on the possibility of stock appreciation and sell their shares to realize a return on their investment.We are dependent upon continued availability of financing to manage our business and to execute our business strategy, and additional financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us.Our ability to manage our business and to execute our business strategy is dependent, in part, on the continued availability of debt and equity capital. Access to the debt and equity capital markets may be limited by various factors, including the condition of overall credit markets, general economic factors, interest rates, state of the aviation industry, our financial performance, and credit ratings. Debt and equity capital may not continue to be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. Our inability to obtain financing on favorable terms could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Our existing debt includes restrictive and/or financial covenants.Certain financing arrangements, including our Revolving Credit Facility and our accounts receivable financing program, require us to comply with various restrictive covenants and some contain financial covenants that require us to comply with specified financial ratios and tests. Our failure to meet these covenants could result in default under these loan and debt agreements and may result in a cross-default under other debt agreements. In the event of a default and our inability to obtain a waiver of the default, all amounts outstanding under our debt agreements could be declared immediately due and payable. Our failure to comply with these covenants could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory MattersIf we fail to comply with government procurement laws and regulations, we could lose business and be liable for various penalties or sanctions.We must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of government contracts. In the U.S., these laws and regulations include the Federal Acquisition Regulations, Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations, the Truth in Negotiations Act, Cost Accounting Standards, and laws, regulations, and orders restricting the use and dissemination of classified information under the U.S. export control laws and the export of certain products and technical information and safeguarding of contractor information systems.In addition, we are subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable under government contracts. U.S. government agencies routinely audit government contractors, including the Company, to review performance under contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards, as well as the adequacy of and compliance with internal control systems and policies, including the contractor’s purchasing, property, estimating, compensation and management information systems. Any costs found to be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract are not reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, must be refunded. Also, any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in payments being withheld, penalties and reduced future business.U.S. government rules allow contracting officers to impose contractual withholdings at no less than certain minimum levels if a contracting officer determines that one or more of a contractor’s business systems have one or more significant deficiencies. If a contracting officer were to impose such a withholding on us or even on a prime contractor where we are the subcontractor, it would 16 Table of Contentsincrease the risk that we would not be paid in full or paid timely. If future audit adjustments exceed our estimates, our profitability could be adversely affected.If a government inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or administrative sanctions, including contract termination, fines, forfeiture of fees, suspension of payment and suspension or debarment from doing business with government agencies, any of which could materially adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to significant government regulation and may need to incur significant expenses to comply with new or more stringent governmental regulation.The aviation industry is highly regulated by the FAA in the U.S. and equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. Before we sell any of our products that are to be installed in an aircraft, such as engines, engine parts and components, and airframe and accessory parts and components, they must meet certain standards of airworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in certain other countries. We operate repair stations that are licensed by the FAA and the equivalent regulatory agencies in certain other countries, and hold certificates to operate aircraft. Specific regulations vary from country to country; although regulatory requirements in other countries are generally satisfied by compliance with FAA requirements. New and more stringent governmental regulations may be adopted in the future that, if enacted, may have an adverse impact on us.If any of our material licenses, certificates, authorizations, or approvals were revoked or suspended by the FAA or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.Our industry is susceptible to product and other liability claims, and claims not adequately covered by insurance may adversely affect our financial condition.Our business exposes us to possible claims for property damage and bodily injury or death, which may result if an engine, engine part or component, airframe part or accessory, or any other aviation product that we have sold, manufactured, or repaired fails, or if an aircraft we operated, serviced, or in which our products are installed, has an accident. Claims may arise in the future, and our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us in all circumstances. Additionally, we might not be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost. Any liability claim not covered by adequate insurance could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We could be negatively impacted by stakeholder and market focus on Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) matters.There has been an increasing focus on corporate ESG practices and disclosures over the past few years, and expectations in this area are rapidly evolving. The criteria used to evaluate ESG practices may continue to evolve, which could result in greater expectations and may cause us to undertake costly initiatives to satisfy new criteria and abide by any new disclosure requirements. The increasing attention to sustainability could also result in reduced demand for certain of our products and/or reduced profits. If we are unable to respond effectively, investors may conclude that our ESG policies and/or actions are inadequate and decide not to invest in our stock. If we are perceived to have failed to achieve our ESG initiatives or accurately disclose our progress on such matters, our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.We must comply with extensive environmental requirements, and any exposure to environmental liabilities may adversely affect us.Federal, state, and local requirements relating to the discharge and emission of substances into the environment, the disposal of hazardous wastes, the remediation and abatement of contaminants, and other activities affecting the environment have had and may continue to have an impact on our operations. Management cannot assess the possible effect of compliance with future environmental requirements or of future environmental claims for which we may not have adequate indemnification or insurance coverage. If we were required to pay the expenses related to any future environmental claims for which neither indemnification nor insurance coverage were available, these expenses could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.17 Table of ContentsFuture environmental regulatory developments in the United States and abroad concerning environmental issues, such as climate change, could adversely affect our operations and increase operating costs and, through their impact on our customers, reduce demand for our products and services. Actions may be taken in the future by the U.S. government, state governments within the United States, foreign governments, or the International Civil Aviation Organization to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases by the aviation industry. The precise nature of any such requirements and their applicability to us and our customers are difficult to predict, but the impact to us and the aviation industry would likely be adverse and could be significant, including the potential for increased fuel costs, carbon taxes or fees, or a requirement to purchase carbon credits.​",39561,rf,20230718,2023,10K,real_textdata_2023

We caution the reader that these risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risks and uncertainties, nor can it assess the extent to which any of the risk factors below or any such new risks and uncertainties, or any combination thereof, may impact our business. These risks are more fully described in Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors. These risks include, among others, the following:Risks Related to our Business and Industry•Downturns in economic conditions could adversely affect our business. •We will need to obtain sufficient financing or other capital to operate successfully.•Our high level of debt and other obligations may limit our ability to fund general corporate requirements and obtain additional financing, may limit our flexibility in responding to competitive developments and may cause our business to be vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions.•We have significant pension and other postretirement benefit funding obligations, which may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.•If our financial condition worsens, provisions in our credit card processing and other commercial agreements may adversely affect our liquidity.•The loss of key personnel upon whom we depend to operate our business or the inability to attract and develop additional qualified personnel could adversely affect our business.•Our business has been and will continue to be affected by many changing economic and other conditions beyond our control, including global events that affect travel behavior, and our results of operations could be volatile and fluctuate due to seasonality. •Union disputes, employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions, or our inability to otherwise maintain labor costs at competitive levels and hire and retain a sufficient number of employees may adversely affect our operations and financial performance.•If we encounter problems with any of our third-party regional operators or third-party service providers, our operations could be adversely affected by a resulting decline in revenue or negative public perception about our services.•Any damage to our reputation or brand image could adversely affect our business or financial results.•Changes to our business model that are designed to increase revenues may not be successful and may cause operational difficulties or decreased demand.•Our intellectual property rights, particularly our branding rights, are valuable, and any inability to protect them may adversely affect our business and financial results.•We may be a party to litigation in the normal course of business or otherwise, which could affect our financial position and liquidity.•Our ability to utilize our NOLs and other carryforwards may be limited.3Table of Contents•We have a significant amount of goodwill, which is assessed for impairment at least annually. In addition, we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets or long-lived assets, causing us to record material impairment charges.•The airline industry is intensely competitive and dynamic.•The commercial relationships that we have with other companies, including any related equity investments, may not produce the returns or results we expect.•Our business is very dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Continued periods of high volatility in fuel costs, increased fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a significant negative impact on consumer demand, our operating results and liquidity.•Our business is subject to extensive government regulation, which may result in increases in our costs, disruptions to our operations, limits on our operating flexibility, reductions in the demand for air travel, and competitive disadvantages.•We operate a global business with international operations that are subject to economic and political instability and have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by numerous events, circumstances or government actions beyond our control.•We may be adversely affected by conflicts overseas or terrorist attacks; the travel industry continues to face ongoing security concerns.•We are subject to risks associated with climate change, including increased regulation of our CO2 emissions, changing consumer preferences and the potential increased impacts of severe weather events on our operations and infrastructure.•A shortage of pilots or other personnel has in the past and could continue to materially adversely affect our business.•We depend on a limited number of suppliers for aircraft, aircraft engines and parts. Delays in scheduled aircraft deliveries or other loss of anticipated fleet capacity, and failure of new aircraft to perform as expected, may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.•We rely heavily on technology and automated systems to operate our business, and any failure of these technologies or systems could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.•Evolving cybersecurity and data privacy requirements (in particular, compliance with applicable federal, state and foreign laws relating to handling of personal information about individuals) could increase our costs, and any significant data security or privacy incident could disrupt our operations, harm our reputation, expose us to legal risks and otherwise materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.•We rely on third-party distribution channels and must manage effectively the costs, rights and functionality of these channels.•If we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate facilities and infrastructure throughout our system and, at some airports, adequate slots, we may be unable to operate our existing flight schedule and to expand or change our route network in the future, which may have a material adverse impact on our operations.4Table of Contents ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSBelow are certain risk factors that may affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, or the trading price of our common stock or other securities. We caution the reader that these risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risks and uncertainties, nor can it assess the extent to which any of the risk factors below or any such new risks and uncertainties, or any combination thereof, may impact our business.Risks Related to our Business and IndustryDownturns in economic conditions could adversely affect our business.Due to the discretionary nature of business and leisure travel spending and the highly competitive nature of the airline industry, our revenues are heavily influenced by the condition of the U.S. economy and economies in other regions of the world. Unfavorable conditions in these broader economies have resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased passenger demand for air travel, changes in booking practices and related reactions by our competitors, all of which in turn have had, and may have in the future, a strong negative effect on our business. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic and associated decline in economic activity and increase in unemployment levels had a severe and prolonged effect on the global economy generally and, in turn, resulted in a prolonged period of depressed demand for air travel. In addition, a rapid economic expansion following the height of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant inflationary pressures and volatility in certain currencies, which have increased our costs for aircraft fuel, wages and benefits and other goods and services we require to operate our business, as well as increasing the interest expense on our variable-rate indebtedness. We will need to obtain sufficient financing or other capital to operate successfully.Our business plan contemplates continued significant investments related to our fleet, improving the experience of our customers and updating our facilities. Significant capital resources will be required to execute this plan. We estimate that, based on our commitments as of June 30, 2023, our planned aggregate expenditures for aircraft purchase commitments and certain engines on a consolidated basis for the remainder of 2023 through 2027 would be approximately $12.6 billion. We may also require financing to refinance maturing obligations and to provide liquidity to fund other corporate requirements. Accordingly, we will need substantial liquidity, financing or other capital resources to finance such aircraft and engines and meet such other liquidity needs. If needed, it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all, due to, among other factors: our substantial level of existing indebtedness, particularly following the additional liquidity transactions completed in response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; our non-investment grade credit rating; volatile or otherwise unfavorable market conditions; and the availability of assets to use as collateral for loans or other indebtedness, which has been reduced significantly as a result of certain financing transactions we have undertaken since the beginning of 2020 and may be further reduced. If we are unable to arrange any such required financing at customary advance rates and on terms and conditions acceptable to us, we may need to use cash from operations or cash on hand to purchase aircraft and engines or fund our other corporate requirements, or may seek to negotiate deferrals for such aircraft and engines with the applicable manufacturers or otherwise defer corporate obligations. Depending on numerous factors applicable at the time we seek capital, many of which are out of our control, such as the state of the domestic and global economies, the capital and credit markets’ view of our prospects and the airline industry in general, and the general availability of debt and equity capital, the financing or other capital resources that we will need may not be available to us, or may be available only on onerous terms and conditions. Furthermore, we hold significant balances of cash and short-term investments, including as necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations, some of which are held in deposit accounts at commercial banks in excess of the government-provided deposit insurance. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining financing or other needed sources of capital to operate successfully or to fund our committed expenditures. An inability to obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms would limit our ability to execute necessary capital projects and would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.61Table of ContentsOur high level of debt and other obligations may limit our ability to fund general corporate requirements and obtain additional financing, may limit our flexibility in responding to competitive developments and may cause our business to be vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions.We have significant amounts of indebtedness and other financial obligations, including pension obligations, obligations to make future payments on flight equipment and property leases related to airport and other facilities, and substantial non-cancelable obligations under aircraft and related spare engine purchase agreements. Moreover, currently a very significant portion of our assets are pledged to secure our indebtedness. Our substantial indebtedness and other obligations, which are generally greater than the indebtedness and other obligations of our competitors, could have important consequences. For example, they may:•make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness;•limit our ability to obtain additional funding for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments and general corporate purposes, and adversely affect the terms on which such funding can be obtained;•require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our liquidity or cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness and other obligations, thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes;•make us more vulnerable to economic downturns, industry conditions and catastrophic external events, particularly relative to competitors with lower relative levels of financial leverage;•significantly constrain our ability to respond, or respond quickly, to unexpected disruptions in our own operations, the U.S. or global economies, or the businesses in which we operate, or to take advantage of opportunities that would improve our business, operations, or competitive position versus other airlines;•limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions;•bear interest at floating rates, subjecting us to volatility in interest expenses as interest rates fluctuate;•contain covenants requiring us to maintain an aggregate of at least $2.0 billion of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and amounts available to be drawn under revolving credit facilities and collateral coverage ratios and peak debt service coverage ratios; and•contain restrictive covenants that could, among other things:◦limit our ability to merge, consolidate, sell assets, incur additional indebtedness, issue preferred stock, make investments and pay dividends; and◦if breached, result in an event of default under our other indebtedness.In addition, during the COVID-19 pandemic we were required to obtain a significant amount of additional financing from a variety of sources and we cannot guarantee that we will not need to obtain additional financing in the future. Such financing may include the issuance of additional unsecured or secured debt securities, equity securities and equity-linked securities as well as additional bilateral and syndicated secured and/or unsecured credit facilities, among other items. There can be no assurance as to the timing of any such financing transactions, which may be in the near term, or that we will be able to obtain such additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. Any such actions may be material in nature, could result in the incurrence and issuance of significant additional indebtedness or equity and could impose significant covenants and restrictions to which we are not currently subject. Moreover, as a result of the financing activities we undertook in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of financings with respect to which such covenants and provisions apply has increased, thereby subjecting us to more substantial risk of cross-default and cross-acceleration in the event of breach, and additional covenants and provisions could become binding on us should we seek additional liquidity in the future.The obligations discussed above, including those imposed as a result of any additional financings we may be required to undertake, could also impact our ability to obtain additional financing, if needed, and our flexibility in the conduct of our business, and could materially adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.62Table of ContentsFurther, a substantial amount of our long-term indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating interest rates, which tend to fluctuate based on general short-term interest rates, rates set by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks, the supply of and demand for credit in Treasury repurchase or other markets and general economic conditions. We have not hedged our interest rate exposure with respect to our floating rate debt. Accordingly, our interest expense for any particular period will fluctuate based on the relevant benchmark rate and other variable interest rates. In 2022 and continuing into 2023, in response to rising inflation which coincided with a rapid rebound of economic activity as governments lifted restrictions and economies reopened following the COVID-19 pandemic, central banks around the world—including the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England—commenced a cycle of raising interest rates, which has consequently increased the interest we pay on our floating-rate indebtedness. To the extent the interest rates applicable to our floating rate debt increase, our interest expense will increase, in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs, and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected. On July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced its intention to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The discontinuation date for submission and publication of rates for certain tenors of USD LIBOR (1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month) was subsequently extended by the ICE Benchmark Administration (the administrator of LIBOR) until June 30, 2023. It is not possible to predict what rate or rates may become the predominant alternative to LIBOR, or what effect these changes in views or alternatives may have on financial markets. While the U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, has chosen SOFR, and specifically Term SOFR, as the recommended risk-free reference rate for the U.S. (calculated based on repurchase agreements backed by Treasury securities), we cannot currently predict the extent to which this index will gain widespread acceptance as a replacement for LIBOR. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the United Kingdom, the United States or elsewhere. See also the discussion of interest rate risk in Part I, Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – “Interest.”In anticipation of the phase-out of LIBOR as a reference rate, we began amending our LIBOR-based financing arrangements to transition them to successor rates, primarily Term SOFR. As of June 30, 2023, we had implemented amendments to financing arrangements representing substantially all of our variable-rate indebtedness, with approximately $65 million of LIBOR-linked borrowings that are not amended. We cannot predict the consequences of the replacement of LIBOR on financial markets generally or on our business, financial condition or results of operations specifically, and our transition to successor rates could cause the amount of interest payable on our long-term debt to be different or higher than expected.We have significant pension and other postretirement benefit funding obligations, which may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.Our pension funding obligations are significant. The amount of our pension funding obligations will depend on the performance of investments held in trust by the pension plans, interest rates for determining liabilities and actuarial experience. We also have significant obligations for retiree medical and other postretirement benefits. Additionally, we participate in the IAM National Pension Fund (the IAM Pension Fund). The funding status of the IAM Pension Fund is subject to the risk that other employers may not meet their obligations, which under certain circumstances could cause our obligations to increase. On March 29, 2019, the actuary for the IAM Pension Fund certified that the fund was in “endangered” status despite reporting a funded status of over 80%. Additionally, the IAM Pension Fund’s Board voluntarily elected to enter into “critical” status on April 17, 2019. Upon entry into critical status, the IAM Pension Fund was required by law to adopt a rehabilitation plan aimed at restoring the financial health of the pension plan and did so on April 17, 2019 (the Rehabilitation Plan). Under the Rehabilitation Plan, American was subject to an immaterial contribution surcharge, which ceased to apply June 14, 2019 upon American’s mandatory adoption of a contribution schedule under the Rehabilitation Plan. The contribution schedule requires 2.5% annual increases to its contribution rate. This contribution schedule will remain in effect through the earlier of December 31, 2031 or the date the IAM Pension Fund emerges from critical status. Furthermore, if we were to withdraw from the IAM Pension Fund, if the IAM Pension fund were to terminate, or if the IAM Pension Fund were to undergo a mass withdrawal, we could be subject to liability as imposed by law.63Table of ContentsIf our financial condition worsens, provisions in our credit card processing and other commercial agreements may adversely affect our liquidity.We have agreements with companies that process customer credit card transactions for the sale of air travel and other services. These agreements allow these credit card processing companies, under certain conditions (including, with respect to certain agreements, our failure to maintain certain levels of liquidity), to hold an amount of our cash (referred to as a holdback) equal to some or all of the advance ticket sales that have been processed by that credit card processor, but for which we have not yet provided the air transportation. Additionally, such credit card processing companies may require cash or other collateral reserves to be established. These credit card processing companies are not currently entitled to maintain any holdbacks pursuant to these requirements. These holdback requirements can be implemented at the discretion of the credit card processing companies upon the occurrence of specific events, including material adverse changes in our financial condition or the triggering of a liquidity covenant. The imposition of holdback requirements, up to and including 100% of relevant advanced ticket sales, would materially reduce our liquidity. Likewise, other of our commercial agreements contain provisions that allow counterparties to impose less-favorable terms, including the acceleration of amounts due, in the event of material adverse changes in our financial condition. For example, we maintain certain letters of credit as well as insurance- and surety-related agreements under which counterparties may require collateral, including cash collateral.The loss of key personnel upon whom we depend to operate our business or the inability to attract and develop additional qualified personnel could adversely affect our business.We believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to attract, develop and retain highly qualified management, technical and other personnel. Retaining and recruiting people with the appropriate skills is particularly challenging as the economy in general, and the airline industry in particular, continue to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in competition for the human resources necessary to operate our business successfully. We may not be successful in attracting, developing or retaining key personnel or other highly qualified personnel. In addition, competition for skilled personnel has intensified and may continue to intensify if overall industry capacity continues to increase and/or we were to incur attrition at levels higher than we have historically. Any inability to attract, develop and retain significant numbers of qualified management and other personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our business has been and will continue to be affected by many changing economic and other conditions beyond our control, including global events that affect travel behavior, and our results of operations could be volatile and fluctuate due to seasonality.Our business, results of operations and financial condition have been and will continue to be affected by many changing economic and other conditions beyond our control, including, among others:•actual or potential changes in international, national, regional and local economic, business and financial conditions, including recession, inflation and higher interest rates;•the occurrence of wars, terrorist attacks and political instability;•changes in consumer preferences, perceptions, spending patterns and demographic trends;•changes in the competitive environment due to industry consolidation, changes in airline alliance affiliations and other factors;•actual or potential disruptions to the U.S. National Airspace System (the ATC system);•increases in costs of safety, security and environmental measures;•outbreaks of diseases that affect travel behavior, such as occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic; and•weather and natural disasters, including increases in frequency, severity or duration of such disasters, and related costs caused by more severe weather due to climate change.The COVID-19 pandemic, along with the measures governments and private organizations worldwide implemented in an attempt to contain its spread, resulted in significant volatility in demand for air travel, which adversely affected our business, operations and financial condition to an unprecedented extent and for a prolonged period. Measures implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic—such as travel restrictions, including testing regimes, “stay at home” and 64Table of Contentsquarantine orders, limitations on public gatherings, cancellation of public events and many others—initially resulted in a precipitous decline in demand for both domestic and international business and leisure travel. In response to this material deterioration in demand, we took a number of aggressive actions to ameliorate the impacts to our business, operations and financial condition. While cases have declined globally and many governments have loosened or lifted COVID-related travel restrictions, the potential for a resurgence of COVID-19, including the emergence and spread of any new variants, and its after effects remain uncertain, and there can be no assurance that any mitigating actions we take in response will be sufficient to avert a deterioration in our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated changes in business practices which may persist. For example, businesses and other travelers may continue to forego air travel in favor of remote or flexible working policies and communication alternatives such as videoconferencing. In addition, businesses may seek to reduce travel costs by requiring the purchase of less expensive tickets, thereby potentially impacting our average revenue per available seat mile.In addition to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, an outbreak of another contagious disease—such as has occurred in the past with the Ebola virus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, H1N1 influenza virus, avian flu, Zika virus or any other similar illness—if it were to become associated with air travel or persist for an extended period, could materially affect the airline industry and us by reducing revenues and adversely impacting our operations and passengers’ travel behavior. As a result of these or other conditions beyond our control, our results of operations could be volatile and subject to rapid and unexpected change. In addition, due to generally weaker demand for air travel during the winter, our revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year could be weaker than revenues in the second and third quarters of the year.Union disputes, employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions, or our inability to otherwise maintain labor costs at competitive levels and hire and retain a sufficient number of employees may adversely affect our operations and financial performance.Relations between air carriers and labor unions in the U.S. are governed by the Railway Labor Act (RLA). Under the RLA, collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) generally contain “amendable dates” rather than expiration dates, and the RLA requires that a carrier maintain the existing terms and conditions of employment following the amendable date through a multi-stage and usually lengthy series of bargaining processes overseen by the National Mediation Board (NMB). As of December 31, 2022, approximately 87% of our employees were represented for collective bargaining purposes by labor unions, and 48% were covered by CBAs that are currently amendable or that will become amendable within one year. For the dates that the CBAs with our major work groups become amendable under the RLA, see “Labor Relations” under",30012,rf,20230720,2023,10Q,real_textdata_2023

We also suggest that management’s discussion and analysis appearing in this report be read in conjunction with the management’s discussion and analysis and consolidated financial statements included in our 2022 Annual Report. Business OverviewPROG Holdings, Inc. (""we,"" ""our,"" ""us,"" the ""Company,"" or ""PROG Holdings"") is a financial technology holding company that provides transparent and competitive payment options to consumers. PROG Holdings has two reportable segments: (i) Progressive Leasing, an in-store, app-based, and e-commerce point-of-sale lease-to-own solutions provider; and (ii) Vive Financial (""Vive""), an omnichannel provider of second-look revolving credit products.Our Progressive Leasing segment provides consumers with lease-purchase solutions through its point-of-sale partner locations and e-commerce website partners (collectively, ""POS partners""). It does so by purchasing the merchandise from the POS partners desired by customers and, in turn, leasing that merchandise to the customers through a cancellable lease-to-own transaction. Progressive Leasing has no stores of its own, but rather offers lease-purchase solutions to the customers of traditional and e-commerce retailers.Our Vive segment primarily serves customers that may not qualify for traditional prime lending offers who desire to purchase goods and services from participating merchants. Vive offers customized programs with services that include revolving loans through private label and Vive-branded credit cards. Vive's current network of POS partner locations and e-commerce websites includes furniture, mattresses, home exercise equipment, and home improvement retailers, as well as medical and dental service providers.On June 25, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of Four Technologies, Inc. (""Four""), an innovative Buy Now, Pay Later company that allows shoppers to pay for merchandise through four interest-free installments. Four’s proprietary platform capabilities and its base of customers and retailers expand PROG Holdings’ ecosystem of financial technology offerings by introducing a payment solution that further diversifies the Company's consumer financial technology offerings. Shoppers use Four to purchase furniture, clothing, electronics, health and beauty products, footwear, jewelry, and other consumer goods from retailers across the United States. Four is not expected to be a reportable segment in 2023 as its financial results are not expected to be material to the Company's consolidated financial results in 2023. Four's financial results are reported within ""Other"" for segment reporting purposes.Macroeconomic and Business EnvironmentThe Company continues to operate in a challenging macroeconomic environment. We believe the rapid increase in the rate of inflation during 2022, and higher year-over-year inflation continuing in 2023, particularly in housing, food, and gas costs, has disproportionately negatively affected the customers we serve and has resulted in an unfavorable impact on our lease portfolio performance and Gross Merchandise Volume (""GMV"") during 2022 and the first half of 2023. While the inflation rate for the second quarter of 2023 was well below the peak levels it reached during the same quarter of 2022, we believe inflation continues to present a challenge to our customers. Customer payment delinquencies and uncollectible renewal payments experienced within our Progressive Leasing segment during much of 2022 significantly exceeded levels experienced during pre-pandemic periods. In response to increasing customer delinquencies and higher write-offs, Progressive Leasing tightened its lease decisioning several times during 2022, resulting in fewer lease approvals and an adverse impact on GMV in 2022 and the first half of 2023. Levels of customer payment delinquencies and uncollectible renewal payments for leases originated after Progressive Leasing further tightened its lease decisioning in mid-2022 improved to levels consistent with pre-pandemic lease portfolio performance. However, any meaningful increase in unemployment rates and/or a recession in the United States may 22result in increasing levels of customer payment delinquencies and related write-offs, which would result in an unfavorable impact on our performance.The significant increase in inflation and interest rates, and fears of a possible recession have also unfavorably impacted consumer confidence within our customer base, resulting in a decrease in demand for the types of merchandise offered by many of our key national and regional POS partners. In light of these macroeconomic challenges and to align the cost structure of our business with our near-term revenue outlook, the Company executed on a number of cost reduction initiatives during 2022 and the first half of 2023 to drive efficiencies and right-size variable costs, while attempting to minimize the negative impact on growth-related initiatives.HighlightsThe following summarizes significant financial highlights from the three months ended June 30, 2023:•We reported revenues of $592.8 million, a decrease of 8.7% compared to the second quarter of 2022. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to a 13.9% decrease in consolidated GMV for the three months ended June 30, 2023, as compared to the same period in the prior year, due to tightened lease decisioning by Progressive Leasing in mid-2022, and decreased customer demand for many of the products offered by our POS partners. Revenues were also impacted by a smaller lease portfolio at the beginning of the quarter as compared to the second quarter of 2022, and a decline in the number of customers electing to exercise early lease buyouts when compared to the same period in the prior year. The decline in revenues was partially offset by improved customer payment activity in the second quarter of 2023, as compared to the second quarter of 2022.•GMV decreased by $72.8 million for Progressive Leasing and $7.2 million for Vive in the second quarter of 2023, compared to the same period in the prior year. These decreases were due to tighter lease and loan decisioning, resulting in fewer lease and loan originations, and the rate of inflation eroding customers' disposable incomes and reducing their demand for many of the goods sold by our POS partners. These negative impacts were partially offset by GMV from our other operations, which increased by $3.2 million primarily due to an increase in Four loan originations in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of 2022. •Earnings before income taxes increased to $52.0 million compared to $27.3 million in the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily driven by improved customer payment activity, fewer customers electing early lease buyouts, lower restructuring costs, and an increase in interest income on the Company's cash and cash equivalent deposits resulting from higher interest rates, partially offset by higher stock-based compensation expense.Key Operating MetricsGross Merchandise Volume. We believe GMV is a key performance indicator of our Progressive Leasing and Vive segments, as it provides the total value of new leases and loans written into our portfolio over a specified time period. GMV does not represent revenues earned by the Company, but rather is a leading indicator we use in forecasting revenues the Company may earn in the short-term. Progressive Leasing's GMV is defined as the retail price of merchandise acquired by Progressive Leasing, which it then expects to lease to its customers. GMV for Vive and Other are defined as gross loan originations. The following table presents our GMV for the Company for the periods presented:Three Months Ended June 30,Change(Unaudited and In Thousands)20232022$%Progressive Leasing$421,220 $494,003 $(72,783)(14.7)%Vive39,850 47,003 (7,153)(15.2)Other14,600 11,394 3,206 28.1 Total GMV$475,670 $552,400 $(76,730)(13.9)%The decrease in Progressive Leasing's and Vive's GMV was primarily due to our tighter lease and loan decisioning in mid 2022 to address the unfavorable economic conditions that were present in 2022, resulting in fewer lease and loan approvals, and also due to the rate of inflation eroding customers' disposable incomes and their demand for many of the goods sold by our POS partners. We believe these factors have unfavorably impacted the generation of new leases and loans. E-commerce channels generated 15.0% of Progressive Leasing's GMV in the second quarter of 2023 compared to 15.6% in the second quarter of 2022. The decrease in total GMV was partially offset by an increase in GMV from our other operations, primarily due to an increase in Four loan originations.23Active Customer Count. Our active customer count represents the total number of customers that have an active lease agreement with Progressive Leasing, or an active loan with Vive or Four. The following table presents our consolidated active customer count, which includes an immaterial number of customers that have both an active lease agreement and loan agreement, for the Company for the periods presented:As of June 30 (Unaudited and In Thousands)20232022Active Customer Count:Progressive Leasing843 965 Vive90 90 Other23 22 Total Active Customer Count956 1,077 The decrease in the number of Progressive Leasing customers was primarily due to a decrease in customer demand for the types of merchandise typically purchased through our lease-to-own solutions and the tightening of our lease decisioning in 2022 to address the unfavorable economic conditions that were driving higher customer payment delinquencies and uncollectible renewal payments during much of 2022. The number of Vive and Other customers remained consistent compared to the second quarter of 2022. Key Components of Earnings Before Income TaxesIn this MD&A section, we review our condensed consolidated results. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and the comparable prior year period, some of the key revenue, cost and expense items that affected earnings before income taxes were as follows: Revenues. We separate our total revenues into two components: (i) lease revenues and fees and (ii) interest and fees on loans receivable. Lease revenues and fees include all revenues derived from lease agreements from our Progressive Leasing segment. Lease revenues are recorded net of a provision for uncollectible renewal payments. Interest and fees on loans receivable represents merchant fees, finance charges and annual and other fees earned on outstanding loans in our Vive segment and, to a lesser extent, from Four.Depreciation of Lease Merchandise. Depreciation of lease merchandise primarily reflects the expense associated with depreciating merchandise leased to customers by Progressive Leasing.Provision for Lease Merchandise Write-offs. The provision for lease merchandise write-offs represents the estimated merchandise losses incurred but not yet identified by management and adjustments for changes in estimates for the allowance for lease merchandise write-offs.Operating Expenses. Operating expenses include personnel costs, stock-based compensation expense, occupancy costs, advertising, professional services expense, sales acquisition expense, computer software expense, bank service charges, the provision for loan losses, fixed asset depreciation expense, intangible asset amortization, and restructuring, among other expenses.Interest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net consists of interest incurred on the Company's Senior Notes and senior secured revolving credit facility (the ""Revolving Facility""). Interest expense is presented net of interest income earned on the Company's deposits in cash and cash equivalents. 24Results of Operations – Three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 Three Months Ended June 30,Change(In Thousands)20232022$%REVENUES:Lease Revenues and Fees$574,839 $631,344 $(56,505)(8.9)%Interest and Fees on Loans Receivable18,007 18,100 (93)(0.5)592,846 649,444 (56,598)(8.7)COSTS AND EXPENSES:Depreciation of Lease Merchandise384,874 439,113 (54,239)(12.4)Provision for Lease Merchandise Write-Offs40,965 61,788 (20,823)(33.7)Operating Expenses107,710 111,606 (3,896)(3.5)533,549 612,507 (78,958)(12.9)OPERATING PROFIT59,297 36,937 22,360 60.5 Interest Expense, Net(7,283)(9,608)2,325 24.2 EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAX EXPENSE52,014 27,329 24,685 90.3 INCOME TAX EXPENSE14,796 7,845 6,951 88.6 NET EARNINGS$37,218 $19,484 $17,734 91.0 %RevenuesInformation about our revenues by source and reportable segment is as follows: Three Months Ended June 30, 2023Three Months Ended June 30, 2022(In Thousands)Progressive LeasingViveOtherTotalProgressive LeasingViveOtherTotalLease Revenues and Fees$574,839 $— $— $574,839 $631,344 $— $— $631,344 Interest and Fees on Loans Receivable— 17,187 820 18,007 — 17,518 582 18,100 Total $574,839 $17,187 $820 $592,846 $631,344 $17,518 $582 $649,444 The decrease in Progressive Leasing revenues was primarily due to a 14.7% decrease in Progressive Leasing's GMV for the three months ended June 30, 2023, as compared to the same period in the prior year, due to tightened lease decisioning beginning in mid-2022, and decreased customer demand for many of the products offered by our POS partners. Revenues were also impacted by a smaller lease portfolio at the beginning of the quarter as compared to the second quarter of 2022, and a decline in the number of customers electing to exercise early lease buyouts when compared to the same period in the prior year. The decline in revenues was partially offset by improved customer payment activity in the second quarter of 2023, as compared to the second quarter of 2022. Vive and Other revenues remained relatively flat as compared to the second quarter of 2022.25Operating ExpensesInformation about certain significant components of operating expenses for the second quarter of 2023 as compared to the second quarter of 2022 is as follows: Three Months Ended June 30,Change(In Thousands)20232022$%Personnel Costs1$46,852 $49,282 $(2,430)(4.9)%Stock-Based Compensation6,845 2,417 4,428 183.2 Occupancy Costs1,296 1,740 (444)(25.5)Advertising3,637 3,543 94 2.7 Professional Services7,149 6,317 832 13.2 Sales Acquisition Expense26,726 7,796 (1,070)(13.7)Computer Software Expense36,412 6,522 (110)(1.7)Bank Service Charges2,719 3,082 (363)(11.8)Other Sales, General and Administrative Expense8,404 9,262 (858)(9.3)Sales, General and Administrative Expense490,040 89,961 79 0.1 Provision for Loan Losses8,791 8,778 13 0.1 Depreciation and Amortization7,916 8,539 (623)(7.3)Restructuring Expense963 4,328 (3,365)(77.7)Operating Expenses$107,710 $111,606 $(3,896)(3.5)%1 Personnel costs excludes stock-based compensation expense, which is reported separately in the operating expense table.2 Sales acquisition expense includes vendor incentives and rebates to POS partners, external sales commissions, amortization of initial direct costs and amounts paid to various POS partners to be their exclusive provider of lease-to-own solutions.3 Computer software expense consists primarily of software subscription fees, licensing fees and non-capitalizable software implementation costs.4 Progressive Leasing's sales, general and administrative expense was $78.3 million and $81.9 million during the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.The decrease in personnel costs of $2.4 million was driven primarily by a decrease of $3.0 million at Progressive Leasing, attributable to its reduction in the number of employees during the second half of 2022 as part of its restructuring and cost cutting initiatives. Personnel costs attributable to Four and other strategic businesses also decreased by $0.2 million compared to the same period in 2022. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $0.8 million at Vive.Stock-based compensation increased $4.4 million compared to the same period in 2022, consisting of increases of $2.3 million at Progressive Leasing, $1.9 million at Four and other strategic businesses, and $0.2 million at Vive. The increases at Progressive Leasing and Four were primarily due to the Company determining in the second quarter of 2022 that tranches of performance stock units granted earlier in 2022 were no longer probable of being earned, resulting in the reversal of stock-based compensation expense. Stock-based compensation was also impacted by increases to the estimated number of performance stock units expected to be earned from those granted in 2023, resulting in an increase of stock-based compensation expense for these awards during the second quarter of 2023.Restructuring expense decreased $3.4 million due to a decline in restructuring activities during the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. For the three months ended June 30, 2023, restructuring costs were primarily related to employee severance within Progressive Leasing. For the same period in 2022, restructuring costs included a higher amount of employee severance within Progressive Leasing, in addition to operating lease right-of-use asset impairment charges related to the relocation of the Vive corporate headquarters and a reduction of Progressive Leasing call center office space. Other Costs and ExpensesDepreciation of lease merchandise. Depreciation of lease merchandise decreased by 12.4% during the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. The decrease was primarily due to the decline in GMV resulting from Progressive Leasing's tightening of its decisioning in mid-2022. As a percentage of total lease revenues and fees, depreciation of lease merchandise decreased to 67.0% from 69.6% in the prior year quarter, primarily due to improved customer payment activity and lower early buyouts in the three months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022.26Provision for lease merchandise write-offs. The provision for lease merchandise write-offs decreased $20.8 million due to a reduction in the size of Progressive Leasing's lease portfolio during the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. The provision for lease merchandise write-offs also decreased due to improved customer payment activity and lower write-offs in the second quarter of 2023, resulting from Progressive Leasing's tightening of its decisioning in mid-2022, as compared to the higher customer delinquencies and write-offs experienced in the second quarter of 2022. Given the significant economic uncertainty resulting from inflation, rising interest rates, the resumption of student loan repayment obligations in October 2023, and the potential effects of such developments on Progressive Leasing's POS partners, customers, and business going forward, a high level of estimation was involved in determining the allowance as of June 30, 2023. Actual lease merchandise write-offs could differ materially from the allowance for those write-offs.The provision for lease merchandise write-offs as a percentage of lease revenues decreased to 7.1% during the three months ended June 30, 2023 from 9.8% in the same period in 2022. The decrease in the provision was a result of improved customer payment activity and lower write-offs due to the Company tightening its lease decisioning in mid-2022.Interest expense, net. Interest expense, net decreased $2.3 million due to interest income earned on the Company's deposits in cash and cash equivalents resulting from higher interest rates. The Company earned interest income of $2.4 million during the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to an immaterial amount during the same period in 2022.Information about interest expense and interest income is as follows: Three Months Ended June 30,Change(In Thousands)20232022$%Interest Expense, Net: Interest Expense$9,672 $9,656 $16 0.2 %Interest Income(2,389)(48)(2,341)nmfTotal Interest Expense, Net$7,283 $9,608 $(2,325)(24.2)%nmf - Calculation is not meaningfulEarnings Before Income Tax ExpenseInformation about our earnings before income tax expense by reportable segment is as follows: Three Months Ended June 30,Change(In Thousands)20232022$%EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAX EXPENSE:Progressive Leasing$55,422 $27,383 $28,039 102.4 %Vive1,758 3,355 (1,597)(47.6)Other(5,166)(3,409)(1,757)(51.5)Total Earnings Before Income Tax Expense$52,014 $27,329 $24,685 90.3 %The loss before income tax expense within Other primarily relates to our Four operations.

Revenues were also impacted by a smaller lease portfolio at the beginning of the period as compared to the same period in the prior year, and a decline in the number of customers electing to exercise early lease buyouts during the six months ended June 30, 2023, as compared to the same period in 2022. The decline in revenues was partially offset by improved customer payment activity in the first half of 2023, as compared to the first half of 2022. Vive revenues remained relatively flat as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2022 and the increase in ""Other"" revenue was primarily driven by strong GMV growth within our Four operations.28Operating ExpensesInformation about certain significant components of operating expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2022 is as follows: Six Months Ended June 30,Change(In Thousands)20232022$%Personnel Costs1$93,913 $102,867 $(8,954)(8.7)%Stock-Based Compensation12,260 9,040 3,220 35.6 Occupancy Costs2,679 3,344 (665)(19.9)Advertising6,959 8,047 (1,088)(13.5)Professional Services11,706 11,772 (66)(0.6)Sales Acquisition Expense213,972 13,889 83 0.6 Computer Software Expense312,659 13,118 (459)(3.5)Bank Service Charges5,634 6,512 (878)(13.5)Other Sales, General and Administrative Expense18,067 18,866 (799)(4.2)Sales, General and Administrative Expense4177,849 187,455 (9,606)(5.1)Provision for Loan losses17,505 16,460 1,045 6.3 Depreciation and Amortization15,895 17,021 (1,126)(6.6)Restructuring Expense1,720 4,328 (2,608)(60.3)Operating Expenses$212,969 $225,264 $(12,295)(5.5)%1 Personnel costs excludes stock-based compensation expense, which is reported separately in the operating expense table.2 Sales acquisition expense includes vendor incentives and rebates to POS partners, external sales commissions, amortization of initial direct costs and amounts paid to various POS partners to be their exclusive provider of lease-to-own solutions.3 Computer software expense consists primarily of software subscription fees, licensing fees and non-capitalizable software implementation costs.4 Progressive Leasing's sales, general and administrative expense was $154.2 million and $167.9 million during the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.The decrease in personnel costs of $9.0 million was driven by a decrease of $10.0 million at Progressive Leasing attributable to its reduction in the number of employees during the second half of 2022 as part of its restructuring and cost cutting initiatives. Personnel costs attributable to Four and other strategic businesses also decreased by $0.7 million during the same period in 2022. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $1.7 million at Vive.Stock-based compensation increased $3.2 million compared to 2022, consisting of increases of $1.8 million at Progressive Leasing, $1.0 million at Four and other strategic businesses, and $0.4 million at Vive. The lower stock-based compensation in 2022 was the result of: (i) the Company determining in the second quarter of 2022 that performance stock units that had been granted to Four executives were no longer probable of being earned; (ii) the reversal of the stock-based compensation expense for performance stock units granted in 2022 that were tied to the performance of Progressive Leasing, based upon the Company's determination that those performance units were no longer probable of being earned; and (iii) other stock-based forfeitures related to the Progressive Leasing restructuring program. During 2023, the estimated payout of performance stock units granted in 2023 was increased based on revisions to the Company's forecasted results, further increasing the stock-based compensation expense during the six months ended June 30, 2023.Restructuring expense decreased $2.6 million primarily due to a decline in restructuring activities during the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, restructuring costs were primarily related to employee severance within Progressive Leasing. For the same period in 2022, restructuring costs included a higher amount of employee severance within Progressive Leasing, in addition to operating lease right-of-use asset impairment charges related to the relocation of the Vive corporate headquarters and a reduction of Progressive Leasing call center office space. Other Costs and ExpensesDepreciation of lease merchandise. Depreciation of lease merchandise decreased by 12.4% during the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. The decrease was primarily due to the decline in GMV resulting from Progressive Leasing's tightening of its decisioning in mid-2022. As a percentage of total lease revenues and fees, depreciation of lease merchandise decreased to 67.7% from 70.7% in the prior year period, primarily due to improved customer payment activity and lower early buyouts in the six months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022.29Provision for lease merchandise write-offs. The provision for lease merchandise write-offs decreased $32.8 million due to a reduction in the size of Progressive Leasing's lease portfolio during the six months ended June 30, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022. The provision for lease merchandise write-offs as a percentage of lease revenues decreased to 6.5% during the six months ended June 30, 2023 from 8.5% in the same period in 2022. The decrease in the provision was a result of improved customer payment activity and lower write-offs due to the Company tightening its lease decisioning in mid-2022. Given the significant economic uncertainty resulting from the rate of the increase in inflation, rising interest rates, and the potential effects of such developments on Progressive Leasing's POS partners, customers, and business going forward, a high level of estimation was involved in determining the allowance as of June 30, 2023. Actual lease merchandise write-offs could differ materially from the allowance for those write-offs.Interest expense, net. Interest expense, net decreased $3.5 million due to interest income earned on the Company's deposits in cash and cash equivalents resulting from higher interest rates. The Company earned interest income of $3.6 million during the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to $0.1 million during the same period in 2022.Information about interest expense and interest income is as follows:Six Months Ended June 30,Change(In Thousands)20232022$%Interest Expense, Net: Interest Expense$19,370 $19,290 $80 0.4 %Interest Income(3,596)(53)(3,543)nmfTotal Interest Expense, Net$15,774 $19,237 $(3,463)(18.0)%nmf - Calculation is not meaningfulEarnings Before Income Tax ExpenseInformation about our earnings before income tax expense by reportable segment is as follows:Six Months EndedJune 30,Change(In Thousands)20232022$%EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAX EXPENSE:Progressive Leasing$126,473 $69,464 $57,009 82.1 %Vive3,921 7,778 (3,857)(49.6)Other(10,793)(10,077)(716)(7.1)Total Earnings Before Income Tax Expense$119,601 $67,165 $52,436 78.1 %The loss before income tax expense within ""Other"" primarily relates to our Four operations. Factors impacting the change in earnings before income tax expense for each reporting segment are discussed above.Income Tax Expense Income tax expense increased to $34.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to $20.5 million in the prior year comparable period due to lower earnings before income tax expense in the prior year period. The effective tax rate was 28.7% during the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to 30.6% in the same period in 2022. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by higher earnings before income tax expense.30Overview of Financial PositionThe major changes in the condensed consolidated balance sheet from December 31, 2022 to June 30, 2023 include: •Cash and cash equivalents increased $120.9 million to $252.8 million during the six months ended June 30, 2023. For additional information, refer to the ""Liquidity and Capital Resources"" section below. •Lease merchandise, net of accumulated depreciation and allowances, decreased $99.1 million due primarily to a 22.1% decrease in Progressive Leasing's GMV for the second quarter of 2023 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022.•Accounts Receivable, net of allowances, decreased $11.3 million primarily due to a 22.1% decrease in Progressive Leasing's GMV for the second quarter of 2023 compared to the fourth quarter of 2022.31Liquidity and Capital ResourcesGeneralWe expect that our primary capital requirements will consist of:•Reinvesting in our business, including buying merchandise for the operations of Progressive Leasing. Because we believe Progressive Leasing will continue to grow over the long-term, we expect that the need for additional lease merchandise will remain a major capital requirement; •Making merger and acquisition investment(s) to further broaden our product offerings; and•Returning excess cash to shareholders through periodically repurchasing stock.Other capital requirements include (i) expenditures related to software development; (ii) expenditures related to our corporate operating activities; (iii) personnel expenditures; (iv) income tax payments; (v) funding of loans receivable for Vive; and (vi) servicing our outstanding debt obligation. Our capital requirements have been financed through:•cash flows from operations;•private debt offerings;•bank debt; and•stock offerings.As of June 30, 2023, the Company had $252.8 million of cash, $350.0 million of availability under the Revolving Facility, and $600.0 million of indebtedness.Cash Provided by Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities was $205.4 million and $155.7 million during the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The $49.7 million increase in operating cash flows was primarily driven by the $38.6 million increase in net earnings and a $148.5 million decrease in purchases of lease merchandise compared to the same period in 2022. Changes in certain working capital accounts also contributed to operating cash flows. Other changes in cash provided by operating activities are discussed above in our discussion of results for the six months ended June 30, 2023.Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $10.6 million and $22.0 million during the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The $11.4 million decrease in investing cash outflows was primarily the result of a $8.3 million increase in proceeds from loans receivable, while the corresponding decrease in cash outflows for investments in loans receivable was $2.0 million. Cash outflows for the purchase of property and equipment also decreased by $1.1 million compared to the same period in 2022.Cash Used in Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities was $73.8 million during the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to $176.6 million during the same period in 2022. Cash used in financing activities in the six months ended June 30, 2023 was primarily for the Company's repurchase of $71.8 million of its common stock, compared to $176.5 million of share repurchases in the same period in the prior year.32Share RepurchasesWe purchase our stock in the market from time to time as authorized by our Board of Directors. On November 3, 2021, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program that replaced the previous $300 million repurchase program. The Company repurchased 2,541,764 shares for $71.8 million during the six months ended June 30, 2023. That amount does not include any excise tax that may be assessed on those repurchases. As of June 30, 2023, we had the authority to purchase additional shares up to our remaining authorization limit of $265.4 million.Debt FinancingOn November 24, 2020, the Company entered into a credit agreement with a consortium of lenders providing for a $350.0 million senior revolving credit facility, under which revolving borrowings became available on the date of the completion of the separation and distribution transaction pursuant to which our former Aaron's Business segment was spun-off into a separate publicly-traded company, and under which all borrowings and commitments will mature or terminate on November 24, 2025.As of June 30, 2023, the Company had no outstanding balance and $350.0 million remaining available for borrowings on the Revolving Facility. The Revolving Facility includes an uncommitted incremental facility increase option (""Incremental Facilities"") which, subject to certain terms and conditions, permits the Company at any time prior to the maturity date to request an increase in extensions of credit available thereunder by an aggregate additional principal amount of up to $300.0 million. Our Revolving Facility contains certain financial covenants, which include requirements that the Company maintain ratios of (i) total net debt to EBITDA of no more than 2.50:1.00 and (ii) consolidated interest coverage of no less than 3.00:1.00. The Company will be in default under the Revolving Facility if it fails to comply with these covenants, and all borrowings outstanding may become due immediately. Additionally, under the Revolving Facility, if the total net debt to EBITDA, as defined by the Revolving Facility, exceeds 1.25, the revolver becomes fully secured for the remaining duration of the Revolving Facility term. As of June 30, 2022, the Company exceeded the 1.25 total net debt to EBITDA ratio and the Revolving Facility became fully secured. At June 30, 2023, we were in compliance with the financial covenants set forth in the Revolving Facility and believe that we will continue to be in compliance in the future.On November 26, 2021, the Company entered into an indenture in connection with its offering of $600 million aggregate principal amount of its senior unsecured notes due 2029 (the ""Senior Notes""). The Senior Notes were issued at 100.0% of their par value with a stated fixed annual interest rate of 6.00%. Interest accrues on the outstanding balance and is payable semi-annually. The Senior Notes are general unsecured obligations of the Company and are guaranteed by certain of the Company's existing and future domestic subsidiaries. The indenture discussed above contains various other covenants and obligations to which the Company and its subsidiaries are subject while the Senior Notes are outstanding. The covenants in the indenture may limit the extent to which, or the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to, among other things: (i) incur additional debt and guarantee debt; (ii) pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem capital stock; (iii) prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt; (iv) issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities; (v) make loans and investments; (vi) sell assets; (vii) incur liens; (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates; (ix) enter into agreements restricting the ability of the Company’s subsidiaries to pay dividends; and (x) consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of the Company’s assets. The indenture also contains customary events of default for transactions of this type and amount. We were in compliance with these covenants at June 30, 2023 and believe that we will continue to be in compliance in the future. CommitmentsIncome TaxesDuring the six months ended June 30, 2023, we made net tax payments of $53.6 million. Within the next six months, we anticipate making estimated tax payments of $27.7 million for United States federal income taxes and state income taxes. Deferred income tax liabilities as of June 30, 2023 were $116.0 million. Deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their respective book basis, which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the liabilities are settled at their reported financial statement amounts. The results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods.33LeasesWe lease management and information technology space for corporate functions as well as call center space and storage space for our hub facilities under operating leases expiring at various times through 2027. Our corporate and call center leases contain renewal options for additional periods ranging from three to five years. We also lease transportation vehicles under operating leases which generally expire during the next three years. We expect that most leases will be renewed or replaced by other leases in the normal course of business. Contractual Obligations and CommitmentsFuture interest payments on the Company's variable-rate debt are based on a rate per annum equal to, at our option, (i) the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR"") plus a margin within the range of 1.5% to 2.5% for revolving loans, based on total leverage, or (ii) the administrative agent's base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.5% to 1.5%, as specified in the agreement. Future interest payments related to our Revolving Facility are based on the borrowings outstanding at that time. Future interest payments may be different depending on future borrowing activity and interest rates. The Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Facility as of June 30, 2023.On November 26, 2021, the Company issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes that bear a fixed annual interest rate of 6.00%. Interest accrues on the outstanding balance and is payable semi-annually. The Senior Notes will mature on November 15, 2029.The Company has no long-term commitments to purchase merchandise nor does it have significant purchase agreements that specify minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months.Unfunded Lending CommitmentsThe Company, through its Vive business, had unconditionally cancellable unfunded lending commitments totaling approximately $533.0 million and $513.7 million as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, that do not give rise to revenues and cash flows. These unfunded commitments arise in the ordinary course of business from credit card agreements with individual cardholders that give them the ability to borrow, against unused amounts, up to the maximum credit limit assigned to their account. While these unfunded amounts represented the total available unused lines of credit, the Company does not anticipate that all cardholders will utilize their entire available line at any given point in time. Commitments to extend unsecured credit are agreements to lend to a cardholder so long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.Critical Accounting PoliciesRefer to the 2022 Annual Report.Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements, including pronouncements that were adopted in the current year.",43798,mgmt,20230726,2023,10Q,real_textdata_2023

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 reflect the consolidated operations of the Company and its subsidiaries. CECO Environmental Corp. (“CECO,” “we,” “us,” or the “Company”) is a leading environmentally focused, diversified industrial company, serving the broad landscape of industrial air, industrial water and energy transition markets globally providing innovative technology and application expertise. CECO helps companies grow their business with safe, clean, and more efficient solutions that help protect people, the environment and industrial equipment. CECO solutions improve air and water quality, optimize emissions management, and increase the energy and process efficiency for highly engineered applications in power generation, midstream and downstream hydrocarbon processing and transport, chemical processing, electric vehicle production, polysilicon fabrication, semiconductor and electronics production, battery production and recycling, specialty metals, aluminum and steel production, beverage can manufacturing, and industrial and produced water and wastewater treatment, and a wide range of other industrial end markets. Market Pressures The senior management team monitors and manages the Company’s ability to operate effectively as the result of market pressures. In particular, we are currently experiencing challenges in obtaining certain raw materials and labor on a timely basis at a reasonable cost. We expect these supply chain challenges and cost impacts to continue for the foreseeable future. Although we have secured additional raw materials from existing and alternate suppliers and have taken other mitigating actions to mitigate supply disruptions, we cannot guarantee that we can continue to do so in the future. In this event, our business, results and financial condition could be adversely affected. Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). These GAAP financial statements include certain charges the Company believes are not indicative of its core ongoing operational performance. As a result, the Company provides financial information in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis that was not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to the information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company provides this non-GAAP financial information because the Company’s management utilizes it to evaluate its ongoing financial performance and the Company believes it provides greater transparency to investors as supplemental information to its GAAP results. The Company has provided the non-GAAP financial measures of non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin as a result of items that the Company believes are not indicative of its ongoing operations. These include transactions associated with the Company’s acquisitions and the items described below in “Consolidated Results.” The Company believes that evaluation of its financial performance compared with prior and future periods can be enhanced by a presentation of results that exclude the impact of these items. The Company has incurred substantial expense and income associated with acquisitions. While the Company cannot predict the exact timing or amounts of such charges, it does expect to treat the financial impact of these transactions as special items in its future presentation of non-GAAP results. 20 Results of Operations Consolidated Results Our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 are as follows: Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30, (in millions, except ratios) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net sales $ 129.2 $ 105.4 $ 241.7 $ 197.8 Cost of sales 89.4 73.7 167.0 139.7 Gross profit $ 39.8 $ 31.7 $ 74.7 $ 58.1 Percent of sales 30.8 % 30.1 % 30.9 % 29.4 % Selling and administrative expenses 28.4 23.0 55.6 41.6 Percent of sales 22.0 % 21.8 % 23.0 % 21.0 % Amortization and earnout expenses 2.3 1.5 4.0 2.9 Acquisition and integration expenses 0.3 1.5 0.8 2.5 Executive transition expenses 0.2 — 0.2 — Restructuring expenses — — — 0.1 Operating income $ 8.6 $ 5.7 $ 14.1 $ 11.0 Operating margin 6.7 % 5.4 % 5.8 % 5.6 % To compare operating performance between the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company has adjusted GAAP operating income to exclude (1) amortization of intangible assets, earnout and retention expenses, (2) acquisition and integration expenses, which include legal, accounting, and other expenses, (3) executive transition expenses, including fees and expenses incurred in the search, for and hiring, of new executives and (4) restructuring expenses primarily relating to severance, facility exits, and associated legal expenses.

Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 30.9% in the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared with 29.4% in the six months ended June 30, 2022. Selling and administrative expenses were $28.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared with $23.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022. The increase is primarily attributable to acquisitions during the prior and current year, and increased headcount to support our growth and efforts to expand our global footprint. Selling and administrative expenses were $55.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared with $41.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. The increase is primarily attributable to acquisitions during the prior and current year, a $2.5 million favorable insurance settlement in the prior year, and increased headcount to support our growth and efforts to expand our global footprint. Amortization and earnout expense was $2.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared with $1.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022. The increase in expense is attributable to an increase of $0.5 million in earnout expense and an increase of $0.3 million in definite lived asset amortization due to increased intangible assets attributable to current and prior year acquisitions. Amortization and earnout expense was $4.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared with $2.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022.

Operating income increased $2.9 million to $8.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared with operating income of $5.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022. The increase in operating income is primarily attributable to increases in net sales. Operating income increased $3.1 million to $14.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared with operating income of $11.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. The increase in operating income is primarily attributable to increases in net sales. Non-GAAP operating income was $11.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared with $8.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022. Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of sales increased to 8.8% for the three months ended June 30, 2023 from 8.3% for the three months ended June 30, 2022. Non-GAAP operating income was $19.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared with $16.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of sales was 7.9% for the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to 8.3% for the six months ended June 30, 2022. Interest expense increased to $3.8 million in the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared with interest expense of $1.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to increased debt balances and rising interest rates. Interest expense increased to $6.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared with interest expense of $1.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to increased debt balances and rising interest rates. Income tax expense was $1.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared with income tax expense of $1.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022. Income tax expense was $1.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared with income tax expense of $3.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. The effective income tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2023 was 19.8% compared with 28.3% for the three months ended June 30, 2022. The effective income tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2023 was 13.3% compared with 28.3% for the six months ended June 30, 2022. The effective income tax rates 22 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 differ from the United States federal statutory rate. Our effective tax rate is affected by certain other permanent differences, including state income taxes, non-deductible incentive stock-based compensation, and differences in tax rates among the jurisdictions in which we operate. Business Segments The Company’s operations are organized and reviewed by management along its product lines or end market that the segment serves and are presented in two reportable segments. The results of the segments are reviewed through “Income from operations” on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30, (in thousands) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net Sales (less intra- and inter-segment sales) Engineered Systems segment $ 87,522 $ 67,333 $ 161,977 $ 124,308 Industrial Process Solutions segment 41,659 38,042 79,767 73,503 Total net sales $ 129,181 $ 105,375 $ 241,744 $ 197,811 Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30, (in thousands) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Income from Operations Engineered Systems segment $ 14,089 $ 9,006 $ 23,894 $ 15,476 Industrial Process Solutions segment 4,586 5,482 10,131 9,621 Corporate and Other(1) (10,072 ) (8,742 ) (19,961 ) (14,147 ) Total income from operations $ 8,603 $ 5,746 $ 14,064 $ 10,950 (1) Includes corporate compensation, professional services, information technology and other general and administrative corporate expenses. Engineered Systems Segment Our Engineered Systems segment net sales increased $20.2 million to $87.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared with $67.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022. The increase is led by increases of $15.2 million in separation, filtration, and industrial water technologies and $5.4 million in our emissions management technologies. Approximately 90%, or $80.5 million, of net sales for the three months ended June 30, 2023 is attributable to organic revenue. Our Engineered Systems segment net sales increased $37.7 million to $162.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared with $124.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. The increase is led by increases of $27.8 million in separation, filtration, and industrial water technologies and $9.4 million in our thermal acoustics technologies. Approximately 90%, or $143.4 million, of net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2023 is attributable to organic revenue. Operating income for the Engineered Systems segment increased $5.1 million to $14.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared with $9.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022. The increase is primarily attributable to increased sales, partially offset by an increase in direct costs. Operating income for the Engineered Systems segment increased $8.4 million to $23.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared with $15.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. The increase is primarily attributable to increased sales, partially offset by an increase in direct costs. Industrial Process Solutions Segment Our Industrial Process Solutions segment net sales increased $3.7 million to $41.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared with $38.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022. The increase is primarily attributable to increases across all products serving industrial air end markets. Approximately 98%, or $40.7 million, of net sales for the three months ended June 30, 2023 is attributable to organic revenue. Our Industrial Process Solutions segment net sales increased $6.3 million to $79.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared with $73.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. The increase is primarily attributable to increases across all products serving industrial air end markets. Approximately 98%, or $77.8 million, of net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2023 is attributable to organic revenue. 23 Operating income for the Industrial Process Solutions segment decreased $0.9 million to $4.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared with $5.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022. The decrease is primarily attributable to an increase in costs related to materials and labor, partially offset by increased sales. Operating income for the Industrial Process Solutions segment increased $0.5 million to $10.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared with $9.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. The increase is primarily attributable to increased sales, offset by an increase costs related to materials and labor. Corporate and Other Segment Operating expense for the Corporate and Other segment increased $1.4 million to $10.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared with $8.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022. The increase is primarily attributable to investments made to support growth, and inflationary increases for wages and services. Operating expense for the Corporate and Other segment increased $5.9 million to $20.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared with $14.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. The increase is primarily attributable to investments made to support growth, inflationary increases for wages and services, and a favorable insurance settlement of $2.5 million in the prior year period. Backlog Backlog (i.e., unfulfilled or remaining performance obligations) represents the sales we expect to recognize for our products and services for which control has not yet transferred to the customer. Backlog increased to $391.0 million as of June 30, 2023 from $311.7 million as of December 31, 2022, with $49.9 million, or 63%, of the increase due to organic growth. Our customers may have the right to cancel a given order. Historically, cancellations have not been common. Backlog is adjusted on a quarterly basis for adjustments in foreign currency exchange rates. Substantially all backlog is expected to be delivered within 12 to 18 months. Backlog is not defined by GAAP and our methodology for calculating backlog may not be consistent with methodologies used by other companies.

These risks include, among others, the following:Risks Related to our Business and Industry•Downturns in economic conditions could adversely affect our business. •We will need to obtain sufficient financing or other capital to operate successfully.•Our high level of debt and other obligations may limit our ability to fund general corporate requirements and obtain additional financing, may limit our flexibility in responding to competitive developments and may cause our business to be vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions.•We have significant pension and other postretirement benefit funding obligations, which may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.•If our financial condition worsens, provisions in our credit card processing and other commercial agreements may adversely affect our liquidity.•The loss of key personnel upon whom we depend to operate our business or the inability to attract and develop additional qualified personnel could adversely affect our business.•Our business has been and will continue to be affected by many changing economic and other conditions beyond our control, including global events that affect travel behavior, and our results of operations could be volatile and fluctuate due to seasonality. •Union disputes, employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions, or our inability to otherwise maintain labor costs at competitive levels and hire and retain a sufficient number of employees may adversely affect our operations and financial performance.•If we encounter problems with any of our third-party regional operators or third-party service providers, our operations could be adversely affected by a resulting decline in revenue or negative public perception about our services.•Any damage to our reputation or brand image could adversely affect our business or financial results.•Changes to our business model that are designed to increase revenues may not be successful and may cause operational difficulties or decreased demand.•Our intellectual property rights, particularly our branding rights, are valuable, and any inability to protect them may adversely affect our business and financial results.•We may be a party to litigation in the normal course of business or otherwise, which could affect our financial position and liquidity.•Our ability to utilize our NOLs and other carryforwards may be limited.3Table of Contents•We have a significant amount of goodwill, which is assessed for impairment at least annually. In addition, we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets or long-lived assets, causing us to record material impairment charges.•The airline industry is intensely competitive and dynamic.•The commercial relationships that we have with other companies, including any related equity investments, may not produce the returns or results we expect.•Our business is very dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Continued periods of high volatility in fuel costs, increased fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a significant negative impact on consumer demand, our operating results and liquidity.•Our business is subject to extensive government regulation, which may result in increases in our costs, disruptions to our operations, limits on our operating flexibility, reductions in the demand for air travel, and competitive disadvantages.•We operate a global business with international operations that are subject to economic and political instability and have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by numerous events, circumstances or government actions beyond our control.•We may be adversely affected by conflicts overseas or terrorist attacks; the travel industry continues to face ongoing security concerns.•We are subject to risks associated with climate change, including increased regulation of our CO2 emissions, changing consumer preferences and the potential increased impacts of severe weather events on our operations and infrastructure.•A shortage of pilots or other personnel has in the past and could continue to materially adversely affect our business.•We depend on a limited number of suppliers for aircraft, aircraft engines and parts. Delays in scheduled aircraft deliveries or other loss of anticipated fleet capacity, and failure of new aircraft to perform as expected, may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.•We rely heavily on technology and automated systems to operate our business, and any failure of these technologies or systems could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.•Evolving cybersecurity and data privacy requirements (in particular, compliance with applicable federal, state and foreign laws relating to handling of personal information about individuals) could increase our costs, and any significant data security or privacy incident could disrupt our operations, harm our reputation, expose us to legal risks and otherwise materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.•We rely on third-party distribution channels and must manage effectively the costs, rights and functionality of these channels.•If we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate facilities and infrastructure throughout our system and, at some airports, adequate slots, we may be unable to operate our existing flight schedule and to expand or change our route network in the future, which may have a material adverse impact on our operations.4Table of Contents ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSBelow are certain risk factors that may affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, or the trading price of our common stock or other securities. We caution the reader that these risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risks and uncertainties, nor can it assess the extent to which any of the risk factors below or any such new risks and uncertainties, or any combination thereof, may impact our business.Risks Related to our Business and IndustryDownturns in economic conditions could adversely affect our business.Due to the discretionary nature of business and leisure travel spending and the highly competitive nature of the airline industry, our revenues are heavily influenced by the condition of the U.S. economy and economies in other regions of the world. Unfavorable conditions in these broader economies have resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased passenger demand for air travel, changes in booking practices and related reactions by our competitors, all of which in turn have had, and may have in the future, a strong negative effect on our business. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic and associated decline in economic activity and increase in unemployment levels had a severe and prolonged effect on the global economy generally and, in turn, resulted in a prolonged period of depressed demand for air travel. In addition, a rapid economic expansion following the height of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant inflationary pressures and volatility in certain currencies, which have increased our costs for aircraft fuel, wages and benefits and other goods and services we require to operate our business, as well as increasing the interest expense on our variable-rate indebtedness. We will need to obtain sufficient financing or other capital to operate successfully.Our business plan contemplates continued significant investments related to our fleet, improving the experience of our customers and updating our facilities. Significant capital resources will be required to execute this plan. We estimate that, based on our commitments as of September 30, 2023, our planned aggregate expenditures for aircraft purchase commitments and certain engines on a consolidated basis for the remainder of 2023 through 2027 would be approximately $11.2 billion. We may also require financing to refinance maturing obligations and to provide liquidity to fund other corporate requirements. Accordingly, we will need substantial liquidity, financing or other capital resources to finance such aircraft and engines and meet such other liquidity needs. If needed, it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all, due to, among other factors: our substantial level of existing indebtedness, particularly following the additional liquidity transactions completed in response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; our non-investment grade credit rating; volatile or otherwise unfavorable market conditions; and the availability of assets to use as collateral for loans or other indebtedness, which has been reduced significantly as a result of certain financing transactions we have undertaken since the beginning of 2020 and may be further reduced. If we are unable to arrange any such required financing at customary advance rates and on terms and conditions acceptable to us, we may need to use cash from operations or cash on hand to purchase aircraft and engines or fund our other corporate requirements, or may seek to negotiate deferrals for such aircraft and engines with the applicable manufacturers or otherwise defer corporate obligations. Depending on numerous factors applicable at the time we seek capital, many of which are out of our control, such as the state of the domestic and global economies, the capital and credit markets’ view of our prospects and the airline industry in general, and the general availability of debt and equity capital, the financing or other capital resources that we will need may not be available to us, or may be available only on onerous terms and conditions. Furthermore, we hold significant balances of cash and short-term investments, including as necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations, some of which are held in deposit accounts at commercial banks in excess of the government-provided deposit insurance. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining financing or other needed sources of capital to operate successfully or to fund our committed expenditures. An inability to obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms would limit our ability to execute necessary capital projects and would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.64Table of ContentsOur high level of debt and other obligations may limit our ability to fund general corporate requirements and obtain additional financing, may limit our flexibility in responding to competitive developments and may cause our business to be vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions.We have significant amounts of indebtedness and other financial obligations, including pension obligations, obligations to make future payments on flight equipment and property leases related to airport and other facilities, and substantial non-cancelable obligations under aircraft and related spare engine purchase agreements. Moreover, currently a very significant portion of our assets are pledged to secure our indebtedness. Our substantial indebtedness and other obligations, which are generally greater than the indebtedness and other obligations of our competitors, could have important consequences. For example, they may:•make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness;•limit our ability to obtain additional funding for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments and general corporate purposes, and adversely affect the terms on which such funding can be obtained;•require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our liquidity or cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness and other obligations, thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes;•make us more vulnerable to economic downturns, industry conditions and catastrophic external events, particularly relative to competitors with lower relative levels of financial leverage;•significantly constrain our ability to respond, or respond quickly, to unexpected disruptions in our own operations, the U.S. or global economies, or the businesses in which we operate, or to take advantage of opportunities that would improve our business, operations, or competitive position versus other airlines;•limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions;•bear interest at floating rates, subjecting us to volatility in interest expenses as interest rates fluctuate;•contain covenants requiring us to maintain an aggregate of at least $2.0 billion of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and amounts available to be drawn under revolving credit facilities and collateral coverage ratios and peak debt service coverage ratios; and•contain restrictive covenants that could, among other things:◦limit our ability to merge, consolidate, sell assets, incur additional indebtedness, issue preferred stock, make investments and pay dividends; and◦if breached, result in an event of default under our other indebtedness.In addition, during the COVID-19 pandemic we were required to obtain a significant amount of additional financing from a variety of sources and we cannot guarantee that we will not need to obtain additional financing in the future. Such financing may include the issuance of additional unsecured or secured debt securities, equity securities and equity-linked securities as well as additional bilateral and syndicated secured and/or unsecured credit facilities, among other items. There can be no assurance as to the timing of any such financing transactions, which may be in the near term, or that we will be able to obtain such additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. Any such actions may be material in nature, could result in the incurrence and issuance of significant additional indebtedness or equity and could impose significant covenants and restrictions to which we are not currently subject. Moreover, as a result of the financing activities we undertook in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of financings with respect to which such covenants and provisions apply has increased, thereby subjecting us to more substantial risk of cross-default and cross-acceleration in the event of breach, and additional covenants and provisions could become binding on us should we seek additional liquidity in the future.The obligations discussed above, including those imposed as a result of any additional financings we may be required to undertake, could also impact our ability to obtain additional financing, if needed, and our flexibility in the conduct of our business, and could materially adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.65Table of ContentsFurther, a substantial amount of our long-term indebtedness bears interest at floating interest rates, which tend to fluctuate based on general short-term interest rates, rates set by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks, the supply of and demand for credit in Treasury repurchase or other markets and general economic conditions. We have not hedged our interest rate exposure with respect to our floating rate debt. Accordingly, our interest expense for any particular period will fluctuate based on the relevant benchmark rate and other variable interest rates. In 2022 and continuing into 2023, in response to rising inflation which coincided with a rapid rebound of economic activity as governments lifted restrictions and economies reopened following the COVID-19 pandemic, central banks around the world—including the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England—commenced a cycle of raising interest rates, which has consequently increased the interest we pay on our floating-rate indebtedness. To the extent the interest rates applicable to our floating rate debt remain elevated or continue to increase, our interest expense will increase, in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs, and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected. In anticipation of the phase-out of LIBOR as a reference rate in June 2023, the U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, has chosen SOFR, and specifically Term SOFR, as the recommended risk-free reference rate for the U.S. (calculated based on repurchase agreements backed by Treasury securities). Prior to the discontinuation of LIBOR, we amended substantially all of our LIBOR-based financing arrangements to transition them to successor rates, primarily Term SOFR. We cannot predict the extent to which Term SOFR will gain widespread acceptance as a replacement for LIBOR, the consequences of the replacement of LIBOR on financial markets generally or on our business, financial condition or results of operations specifically, and our transition to successor rates could cause the amount of interest payable on our long-term debt to be different or higher than expected.We have significant pension and other postretirement benefit funding obligations, which may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.Our pension funding obligations are significant. The amount of our pension funding obligations will depend on the performance of investments held in trust by the pension plans, interest rates for determining liabilities and actuarial experience. We also have significant obligations for retiree medical and other postretirement benefits. Additionally, we participate in the IAM National Pension Fund (the IAM Pension Fund). The funding status of the IAM Pension Fund is subject to the risk that other employers may not meet their obligations, which under certain circumstances could cause our obligations to increase. On March 29, 2019, the actuary for the IAM Pension Fund certified that the fund was in “endangered” status despite reporting a funded status of over 80%. Additionally, the IAM Pension Fund’s Board voluntarily elected to enter into “critical” status on April 17, 2019. Upon entry into critical status, the IAM Pension Fund was required by law to adopt a rehabilitation plan aimed at restoring the financial health of the pension plan and did so on April 17, 2019 (the Rehabilitation Plan). Under the Rehabilitation Plan, American was subject to an immaterial contribution surcharge, which ceased to apply June 14, 2019 upon American’s mandatory adoption of a contribution schedule under the Rehabilitation Plan. The contribution schedule requires 2.5% annual increases to its contribution rate. This contribution schedule will remain in effect through the earlier of December 31, 2031 or the date the IAM Pension Fund emerges from critical status. Furthermore, if we were to withdraw from the IAM Pension Fund, if the IAM Pension fund were to terminate, or if the IAM Pension Fund were to undergo a mass withdrawal, we could be subject to liability as imposed by law.If our financial condition worsens, provisions in our credit card processing and other commercial agreements may adversely affect our liquidity.We have agreements with companies that process customer credit card transactions for the sale of air travel and other services. These agreements allow these credit card processing companies, under certain conditions (including, with respect to certain agreements, our failure to maintain certain levels of liquidity), to hold an amount of our cash (referred to as a holdback) equal to some or all of the advance ticket sales that have been processed by that credit card processor, but for which we have not yet provided the air transportation. Additionally, such credit card processing companies may require cash or other collateral reserves to be established. These credit card processing companies are not currently entitled to maintain any holdbacks pursuant to these requirements. These holdback requirements can be implemented at the discretion of the credit card processing companies upon the occurrence of specific events, including material adverse changes in our financial condition or the triggering of a liquidity covenant. The imposition of holdback requirements, up to and including 100% of relevant advanced ticket sales, would materially reduce our liquidity. Likewise, other of our commercial agreements contain provisions that allow counterparties to impose less-favorable terms, including the acceleration of amounts due, in the event of material adverse changes in our financial condition. For example, we 66Table of Contentsmaintain certain letters of credit as well as insurance- and surety-related agreements under which counterparties may require collateral, including cash collateral.The loss of key personnel upon whom we depend to operate our business or the inability to attract and develop additional qualified personnel could adversely affect our business.We believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to attract, develop and retain highly qualified management, technical and other personnel. Retaining and recruiting people with the appropriate skills is particularly challenging as the economy in general, and the airline industry in particular, continue to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in competition for the human resources necessary to operate our business successfully. We may not be successful in attracting, developing or retaining key personnel or other highly qualified personnel. In addition, competition for skilled personnel has intensified and may continue to intensify if overall industry capacity continues to increase and/or we were to incur attrition at levels higher than we have historically. Any inability to attract, develop and retain significant numbers of qualified management and other personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our business has been and will continue to be affected by many changing economic and other conditions beyond our control, including global events that affect travel behavior, and our results of operations could be volatile and fluctuate due to seasonality.Our business, results of operations and financial condition have been and will continue to be affected by many changing economic and other conditions beyond our control, including, among others:•actual or potential changes in international, national, regional and local economic, business and financial conditions, including recession, inflation and higher interest rates;•the occurrence of wars, terrorist attacks and political instability;•changes in consumer preferences, perceptions, spending patterns and demographic trends;•changes in the competitive environment due to industry consolidation, changes in airline alliance affiliations and other factors;•actual or potential disruptions to the U.S. National Airspace System (the ATC system);•increases in costs of safety, security and environmental measures;•outbreaks of diseases that affect travel behavior, such as occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic; and•weather and natural disasters, including increases in frequency, severity or duration of such disasters, and related costs caused by more severe weather due to climate change.The COVID-19 pandemic, along with the measures governments and private organizations worldwide implemented in an attempt to contain its spread, resulted in significant volatility in demand for air travel, which adversely affected our business, operations and financial condition to an unprecedented extent and for a prolonged period. Measures implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic—such as travel restrictions, including testing regimes, “stay at home” and quarantine orders, limitations on public gatherings, cancellation of public events and many others—initially resulted in a precipitous decline in demand for both domestic and international business and leisure travel. In response to this material deterioration in demand, we took a number of aggressive actions to ameliorate the impacts to our business, operations and financial condition. While cases have declined globally and governments have loosened or lifted COVID-related travel restrictions, the potential for a resurgence of COVID-19, including the emergence and spread of any new variants, and its after effects remain uncertain, and there can be no assurance that any mitigating actions we take in response will be sufficient to avert a deterioration in our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated changes in business practices which may persist. For example, businesses and other travelers may continue to forego air travel in favor of remote or flexible working policies and communication alternatives such as videoconferencing. In addition, businesses may seek to reduce travel costs by requiring the purchase of less expensive tickets, thereby potentially impacting our average revenue per available seat mile.In addition to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, an outbreak of another contagious disease—such as has occurred in the past with the Ebola virus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, H1N1 influenza virus, avian flu, Zika virus or any other similar illness—if it were to become associated with air travel or persist 67Table of Contentsfor an extended period, could materially affect the airline industry and us by reducing revenues and adversely impacting our operations and passengers’ travel behavior. As a result of these or other conditions beyond our control, our results of operations could be volatile and subject to rapid and unexpected change. In addition, due to generally weaker demand for air travel during the winter, our revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year could be weaker than revenues in the second and third quarters of the year.Union disputes, employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions, or our inability to otherwise maintain labor costs at competitive levels and hire and retain a sufficient number of employees may adversely affect our operations and financial performance.Relations between air carriers and labor unions in the U.S. are governed by the Railway Labor Act (RLA). Under the RLA, collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) generally contain “amendable dates” rather than expiration dates, and the RLA requires that a carrier maintain the existing terms and conditions of employment following the amendable date through a multi-stage and usually lengthy series of bargaining processes overseen by the National Mediation Board (NMB). As of December 31, 2022, approximately 87% of our employees were represented for collective bargaining purposes by labor unions, and 48% were covered by CBAs that are currently amendable or that will become amendable within one year. For the dates that the CBAs with our major work groups become amendable under the RLA, see “Labor Relations” under",28900,rf,20231019,2023,10Q,real_textdata_2023

Risk Factors"" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 (the ""2022 Annual Report"") and in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Except as required by law, the Company undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances after the filing date of this Quarterly Report.The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, including the notes to those statements, appearing elsewhere in this report. We also suggest that management’s discussion and analysis appearing in this report be read in conjunction with the management’s discussion and analysis and consolidated financial statements included in our 2022 Annual Report. Business OverviewPROG Holdings, Inc. (""we,"" ""our,"" ""us,"" the ""Company,"" or ""PROG Holdings"") is a financial technology holding company that provides transparent and competitive payment options to consumers. PROG Holdings has two reportable segments: (i) Progressive Leasing, an in-store, app-based, and e-commerce point-of-sale lease-to-own solutions provider; and (ii) Vive Financial (""Vive""), an omnichannel provider of second-look revolving credit products.Our Progressive Leasing segment provides consumers with lease-purchase solutions through its point-of-sale partner locations and e-commerce website partners (collectively, ""POS partners""). It does so by purchasing the merchandise from the POS partners desired by customers and, in turn, leasing that merchandise to the customers through a cancellable lease-to-own transaction. Progressive Leasing has no stores of its own, but rather offers lease-purchase solutions to the customers of traditional and e-commerce retailers.Our Vive segment primarily serves customers that may not qualify for traditional prime lending offers who desire to purchase goods and services from participating merchants. Vive offers customized programs with services that include revolving loans through private label and Vive-branded credit cards. Vive's current network of POS partner locations and e-commerce websites includes furniture, mattresses, home exercise equipment, and home improvement retailers, as well as medical and dental service providers.On June 25, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of Four Technologies, Inc. (""Four""), an innovative Buy Now, Pay Later company that allows shoppers to pay for merchandise through four interest-free installments. Four’s proprietary platform capabilities and its base of customers and retailers expand PROG Holdings’ ecosystem of financial technology offerings by introducing a payment solution that further diversifies the Company's consumer financial technology offerings. Shoppers use Four to purchase furniture, clothing, electronics, health and beauty products, footwear, jewelry, and other consumer goods from retailers across the United States. Four is not expected to be a reportable segment in 2023 as its financial results are not expected to be material to the Company's consolidated financial results in 2023. Four's financial results are reported within Other for segment reporting purposes.Macroeconomic and Business EnvironmentThe Company continues to operate in a challenging macroeconomic environment. We believe the rapid increase in the rate of inflation during 2022, and higher year-over-year inflation continuing in 2023, particularly in housing, food, and gas costs, has disproportionately negatively affected the customers we serve and has resulted in an unfavorable impact on our lease portfolio performance and Gross Merchandise Volume (""GMV"") during 2022 and 2023. While the inflation rate for the third quarter of 2023 was well below the peak levels it reached during the second and third quarters of 2022, we believe inflation continues to present a challenge to our customers. Customer payment delinquencies and uncollectible renewal payments experienced within our Progressive Leasing segment during much of 2022 significantly exceeded levels experienced during pre-pandemic periods. In response to increasing customer delinquencies and higher write-offs, Progressive Leasing tightened its lease decisioning several times during the first half of 2022, resulting in fewer lease approvals and an adverse impact on GMV in 2022 and 2023. Levels of customer payment delinquencies and uncollectible renewal payments for leases originated after Progressive Leasing further tightened its lease decisioning in mid-2022 improved to levels consistent with pre-pandemic lease portfolio performance. However, any meaningful increase in unemployment rates and/or a recession in the United States may result in 22increasing levels of customer payment delinquencies and related write-offs, which would result in an unfavorable impact on our performance.The significant increase in inflation and interest rates, and fears of a possible recession have also unfavorably impacted consumer confidence within our customer base, resulting in a decrease in demand for the types of merchandise offered by many of our key national and regional POS partners. In light of these macroeconomic challenges and to align the cost structure of our business with our near-term revenue outlook, the Company executed on a number of cost reduction initiatives during 2022 and 2023 to drive efficiencies and right-size variable costs, while attempting to minimize the negative impact on growth-related initiatives.Cybersecurity IncidentAs previously disclosed by the Company on September 21, 2023, Progressive Leasing recently experienced a cybersecurity incident affecting certain data and IT systems of Progressive Leasing. Promptly after detecting the incident, the Company engaged third-party cybersecurity experts and took immediate steps to respond to, remediate and investigate the incident. Law enforcement was also notified. While the Company's investigation into the incident, including identification of the data involved, remains ongoing, at this time, we believe the incident has been contained and there is no ongoing operational impact on our ability to provide our products and services. We maintain insurance, including coverage for cyber-attacks, subject to certain deductibles and policy limitations, in an amount that we believe appropriate. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion regarding our cybersecurity risks.During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred $1.8 million for actual and anticipated costs related to the cybersecurity incident. These costs related primarily to third-party legal and consulting services, and credit monitoring services for Progressive Leasing's customers and employees that were impacted, and are included within professional services expense as a component of operating expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings. The full scope of the costs and related impacts of this incident, including the extent to which these costs will be offset by the Company’s cybersecurity insurance, has not been determined. Although the Company is unable to predict the full impact of this incident, the Company does not currently expect that it will have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.HighlightsThe following summarizes significant financial highlights from the three months ended September 30, 2023:•We reported revenues of $582.9 million, a decrease of 6.9% compared to the third quarter of 2022. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to a smaller lease portfolio, which was a result of the tightened lease decisioning implemented by Progressive Leasing in mid-2022; decreased customer demand for many of the products offered by our POS partners; and a decline in the number of customers electing to exercise early lease buyouts when compared to the same period in the prior year. The decline in revenues was partially offset by improved customer payment activity in the third quarter of 2023, as compared to the third quarter of 2022.•GMV decreased by $28.2 million for Progressive Leasing and $12.7 million for Vive in the third quarter of 2023, compared to the same period in the prior year. These decreases were due to a decrease in demand for many of the products offered by Progressive Leasing's POS partners and tighter loan decisioning for Vive, resulting in fewer leases and loan originations. These negative impacts were partially offset by GMV from our other operations, which increased by $3.8 million primarily due to an increase in Four loan originations in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022.•Earnings before income taxes increased to $48.1 million compared to $27.3 million in the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily driven by improved customer payment activity; the absence of a goodwill impairment loss in the third quarter of 2023, as compared to third quarter of 2022; lower restructuring costs; and an increase in interest income on the Company's cash and cash equivalent deposits resulting from higher interest rates, partially offset by higher stock-based compensation expense.23Key Operating MetricsGross Merchandise Volume. We believe GMV is a key performance indicator of our Progressive Leasing and Vive segments, as it provides the total value of new leases and loans written into our portfolio over a specified time period. GMV does not represent revenues earned by the Company, but rather is a leading indicator we use in forecasting revenues the Company may earn in the short-term. Progressive Leasing's GMV is defined as the retail price of merchandise acquired by Progressive Leasing, which it then expects to lease to its customers. GMV for Vive and Other are defined as gross loan originations. The following table presents our GMV for the Company for the periods presented:Three Months Ended September 30,Change(Unaudited and In Thousands)20232022$%Progressive Leasing$409,169 $437,417 $(28,248)(6.5)%Vive35,243 47,967 (12,724)(26.5)Other19,632 15,786 3,846 24.4 Total GMV$464,044 $501,170 $(37,126)(7.4)%The decrease in Progressive Leasing's GMV was primarily due to a decrease in customer demand for many of the products offered by our POS partners. The decrease in Vive's GMV was primarily a result of tighter loan decisioning in mid-2022 to address the unfavorable economic conditions that were present in 2022, resulting in fewer loan approvals. We believe these factors have unfavorably impacted the generation of new leases and loans. E-commerce channels generated 14.8% of Progressive Leasing's GMV in the third quarter of 2023 compared to 16.5% in the third quarter of 2022. The decrease in total GMV was partially offset by an increase in GMV from our other operations, primarily due to an increase in Four loan originations.Active Customer Count. Our active customer count represents the total number of customers that have an active lease agreement with Progressive Leasing, or an active loan with Vive or Four. The following table presents our consolidated active customer count, which includes an immaterial number of customers that have both an active lease agreement and loan agreement, for the Company for the periods presented:As of September 30 (Unaudited and In Thousands)20232022Active Customer Count:Progressive Leasing820 915 Vive88 92 Other35 27 Total Active Customer Count943 1,034 The decrease in the number of Progressive Leasing customers was primarily due to a decrease in customer demand for the types of merchandise typically purchased through our lease-to-own solutions and the tightening of our lease decisioning in mid-2022 to address the unfavorable economic conditions that were driving higher customer payment delinquencies and uncollectible renewal payments during much of 2022. The decrease in Vive customers was primarily due to a reduction in loan originations as the result of tightened decisioning in mid-2022. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in the number of customers for our other strategic businesses.24Key Components of Earnings Before Income TaxesIn this MD&A section, we review our condensed consolidated results. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and the comparable prior year period, some of the key revenue, cost and expense items that affected earnings before income taxes were as follows: Revenues. We separate our total revenues into two components: (i) lease revenues and fees and (ii) interest and fees on loans receivable. Lease revenues and fees include all revenues derived from lease agreements from our Progressive Leasing segment. Lease revenues are recorded net of a provision for uncollectible renewal payments. Interest and fees on loans receivable represents merchant fees, finance charges and annual and other fees earned on outstanding loans in our Vive segment and, to a lesser extent, from Four.Depreciation of Lease Merchandise. Depreciation of lease merchandise reflects the expense associated with depreciating merchandise leased to customers by Progressive Leasing.Provision for Lease Merchandise Write-offs. The provision for lease merchandise write-offs represents the estimated merchandise losses incurred but not yet identified by management and adjustments for changes in estimates for the allowance for lease merchandise write-offs.Operating Expenses. Operating expenses include personnel costs, stock-based compensation expense, occupancy costs, advertising, professional services expense, sales acquisition expense, computer software expense, bank service charges, the provision for loan losses, fixed asset depreciation expense, intangible asset amortization, and restructuring expense, among other expenses.Impairment of Goodwill. Impairment of goodwill is the partial write-off of the goodwill balance at the Four reporting unit. Refer to Note 1 of these condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the interim goodwill impairment assessment and resulting impairment charge that occurred in the third quarter of 2022.Interest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net consists of interest incurred on the Company's Senior Notes and senior secured revolving credit facility (the ""Revolving Facility""). Interest expense is presented net of interest income earned on the Company's deposits in cash and cash equivalents. 25Results of Operations – Three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 Three Months Ended September 30,Change(In Thousands)20232022$%REVENUES:Lease Revenues and Fees$564,183 $606,585 $(42,402)(7.0)%Interest and Fees on Loans Receivable18,694 19,236 (542)(2.8)582,877 625,821 (42,944)(6.9)COSTS AND EXPENSES:Depreciation of Lease Merchandise381,844 422,589 (40,745)(9.6)Provision for Lease Merchandise Write-Offs36,966 43,537 (6,571)(15.1)Operating Expenses109,183 112,733 (3,550)(3.1)Impairment of Goodwill— 10,151 (10,151)nmf527,993 589,010 (61,017)(10.4)OPERATING PROFIT54,884 36,811 18,073 49.1 Interest Expense, Net(6,775)(9,463)2,688 28.4 EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAX EXPENSE48,109 27,348 20,761 75.9 INCOME TAX EXPENSE13,097 11,343 1,754 15.5 NET EARNINGS$35,012 $16,005 $19,007 118.8 %nmf - Calculation is not meaningfulRevenuesInformation about our revenues by source and reportable segment is as follows: Three Months Ended September 30, 2023Three Months Ended September 30, 2022(In Thousands)Progressive LeasingViveOtherTotalProgressive LeasingViveOtherTotalLease Revenues and Fees$564,183 $— $— $564,183 $606,585 $— $— $606,585 Interest and Fees on Loans Receivable— 17,547 1,147 18,694 — 18,392 844 19,236 Total $564,183 $17,547 $1,147 $582,877 $606,585 $18,392 $844 $625,821 The decrease in Progressive Leasing revenues was primarily the result of a smaller lease portfolio at the beginning of the quarter as compared to the third quarter of 2022 due to a decrease in customer demand for many of the products offered by our POS partners and a decline in the number of customers electing to exercise early lease buyouts when compared to the same period in the prior year. The decline in revenues was partially offset by improved customer payment activity in the third quarter of 2023, as compared to the third quarter of 2022. Vive revenues remained relatively flat as compared to the third quarter of 2022. The increase to Other revenue was primarily driven by a 24.4% increase in Four's GMV as compared to the third quarter of 2022.26Operating ExpensesInformation about certain significant components of operating expenses for the third quarter of 2023 as compared to the third quarter of 2022 is as follows: Three Months Ended September 30,Change(In Thousands)20232022$%Personnel Costs1$46,729 $46,550 $179 0.4 %Stock-Based Compensation6,821 4,890 1,931 39.5 Occupancy Costs1,379 1,657 (278)(16.8)Advertising3,422 2,497 925 37.0 Professional Services7,484 4,428 3,056 69.0 Sales Acquisition Expense26,633 7,720 (1,087)(14.1)Computer Software Expense36,517 6,829 (312)(4.6)Bank Service Charges2,771 2,927 (156)(5.3)Other Sales, General and Administrative Expense8,687 10,106 (1,419)(14.0)Sales, General and Administrative Expense490,443 87,604 2,839 3.2 Provision for Loan Losses10,521 12,031 (1,510)(12.6)Depreciation and Amortization7,981 8,425 (444)(5.3)Restructuring Expense238 4,673 (4,435)(94.9)Operating Expenses$109,183 $112,733 $(3,550)(3.1)%1 Personnel costs excludes stock-based compensation expense, which is reported separately in the operating expense table.2 Sales acquisition expense includes vendor incentives and rebates to POS partners, external sales commissions, amortization of initial direct costs and amounts paid to various POS partners to be their exclusive provider of lease-to-own solutions.3 Computer software expense consists primarily of software subscription fees, licensing fees and non-capitalizable software implementation costs.4 Progressive Leasing's sales, general and administrative expense was $77.2 million and $75.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.Stock-based compensation increased $1.9 million compared to the same period in 2022, consisting of increases of $1.7 million at Progressive Leasing and $0.2 million at Vive. The increase at Progressive Leasing was primarily due to the Company determining in the second quarter of 2022 that tranches of performance stock units granted in 2022 were no longer probable of being earned, resulting in no stock-based compensation expense for those performance stock units during the three months ended September 30, 2022. Stock-based compensation was also impacted by increases to the estimated number of performance stock units expected to be earned from those granted in 2023, resulting in an increase of stock-based compensation expense for those awards during the three months ended September 30, 2023.Professional services increased $3.1 million compared to the same period in 2022, consisting of $2.7 million at Progressive Leasing and $0.3 million at Four and other strategic businesses. The increase at Progressive Leasing was primarily due to costs incurred related to the cybersecurity incident during September 2023. Expenses for other legal services and contract labor also increased compared to the same period in 2022. Costs for professional services for Four and other strategic initiatives increased primarily due to contract labor and legal services during the period.Restructuring expense decreased $4.4 million due to a decline in restructuring activities during the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, restructuring costs were related to employee severance within Progressive Leasing. For the same period in 2022, restructuring costs included impairment of an operating lease right-of-use asset and other property and equipment related to a reduction of Progressive Leasing call center office space, and a higher amount of employee severance within Progressive Leasing. Other Costs and ExpensesDepreciation of lease merchandise. Depreciation of lease merchandise decreased by 9.6% during the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. The decrease was primarily due to the decline in the size of the Company's lease portfolio. As a percentage of total lease revenues and fees, depreciation of lease merchandise decreased to 67.7% from 69.7% in the prior year quarter, primarily due to improved customer payment activity in the three months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022.27Provision for lease merchandise write-offs. The provision for lease merchandise write-offs decreased $6.6 million due to a reduction in the size of Progressive Leasing's lease portfolio during the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. The provision for lease merchandise write-offs also decreased due to improved customer payment activity and lower write-offs in the third quarter of 2023 as compared to the higher customer delinquencies and write-offs experienced in the third quarter of 2022. Given the significant economic uncertainty resulting from inflation, rising interest rates, the resumption of student loan repayment obligations in October 2023, and the potential effects of such developments on Progressive Leasing's POS partners, customers, and business going forward, a high level of estimation was involved in determining the allowance as of September 30, 2023. Actual lease merchandise write-offs could differ materially from the allowance for those write-offs.The provision for lease merchandise write-offs as a percentage of lease revenues decreased to 6.6% during the three months ended September 30, 2023 from 7.2% in the same period in 2022. The decrease in the provision was a result of improved customer payment activity and lower write-offs due to Progressive Leasing tightening its lease decisioning in mid-2022.Impairment of Goodwill. The Company recorded a loss of $10.2 million to partially write-off the goodwill balance of the Four reporting unit during the three months ended September 30, 2022.Interest expense, net.

Factors impacting the change in earnings before income taxes for each reporting segment are discussed above.Income Tax Expense Income tax expense increased to $13.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to $11.3 million in the prior year comparable period due to higher earnings before income tax expense, partially offset by the non-deductible goodwill impairment loss recognized for Four in the third quarter of 2022. The effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was 27.2% compared to 41.5% for the same period in 2022. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by discrete income tax expenses related to the non-deductible goodwill impairment loss for Four of $10.2 million that occurred in the third quarter of 2022.28Results of Operations – Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,Change(In Thousands)20232022$%REVENUES:Lease Revenues and Fees$1,776,104 $1,930,843 $(154,739)(8.0)%Interest and Fees on Loans Receivable54,759 54,886 (127)(0.2)1,830,863 1,985,729 (154,866)(7.8)COSTS AND EXPENSES:Depreciation of Lease Merchandise1,202,157 1,358,713 (156,556)(11.5)Provision for Lease Merchandise Write-Offs116,295 155,655 (39,360)(25.3)Operating Expenses322,152 337,997 (15,845)(4.7)Impairment of Goodwill— 10,151 (10,151)nmf1,640,604 1,862,516 (221,912)(11.9)OPERATING PROFIT190,259 123,213 67,046 54.4 Interest Expense, Net(22,549)(28,700)6,151 21.4 EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAX EXPENSE167,710 94,513 73,197 77.4 INCOME TAX EXPENSE47,447 31,889 15,558 48.8 NET EARNINGS$120,263 $62,624 $57,639 92.0 %nmf - Calculation is not meaningfulRevenuesInformation about our revenues by source and reportable segment is as follows:Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022(In Thousands)Progressive LeasingViveOtherTotalProgressive LeasingViveOtherTotalLease Revenues and Fees$1,776,104 $— $— $1,776,104 $1,930,843 $— $— $1,930,843 Interest and Fees on Loans Receivable— 51,887 2,872 54,759 — 53,026 1,860 54,886 Total Revenues$1,776,104 $51,887 $2,872 $1,830,863 $1,930,843 $53,026 $1,860 $1,985,729 The decrease in Progressive Leasing revenues was primarily the result of having a smaller lease portfolio at the beginning of the period as compared to the same period in the prior year, and a decline in the number of customers electing to exercise early lease buyouts during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the same period in 2022. The smaller lease portfolio was due to a decrease in Progressive Leasing's GMV for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the same period in the prior year, resulting from tightened lease decisioning in mid-2022, and decreased customer demand for many of the products offered by our POS partners.The decline in revenues was partially offset by improved customer payment activity in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the same period in 2022. Vive revenues remained relatively flat as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase to Other revenue was primarily driven by a 39.6% increase in Four's GMV as compared to the same period in 2022.29Operating ExpensesInformation about certain significant components of operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022 is as follows: Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,Change(In Thousands)20232022$%Personnel Costs1$140,642 $147,864 $(7,222)(4.9)%Stock-Based Compensation19,081 13,930 5,151 37.0 Occupancy Costs4,058 5,001 (943)(18.9)Advertising10,381 10,544 (163)(1.5)Professional Services19,190 17,867 1,323 7.4 Sales Acquisition Expense220,605 21,609 (1,004)(4.6)Computer Software Expense319,176 19,947 (771)(3.9)Bank Service Charges8,405 9,439 (1,034)(11.0)Other Sales, General and Administrative Expense26,754 28,858 (2,104)(7.3)Sales, General and Administrative Expense4268,292 275,059 (6,767)(2.5)Provision for Loan losses28,026 28,491 (465)(1.6)Depreciation and Amortization23,876 25,446 (1,570)(6.2)Restructuring Expense1,958 9,001 (7,043)(78.2)Operating Expenses$322,152 $337,997 $(15,845)(4.7)%1 Personnel costs excludes stock-based compensation expense, which is reported separately in the operating expense table.2 Sales acquisition expense includes vendor incentives and rebates to POS partners, external sales commissions, amortization of initial direct costs and amounts paid to various POS partners to be their exclusive provider of lease-to-own solutions.3 Computer software expense consists primarily of software subscription fees, licensing fees and non-capitalizable software implementation costs.4 Progressive Leasing's sales, general and administrative expense was $231.4 million and $243.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.The decrease in personnel costs of $7.2 million was driven by a decrease of $9.4 million at Progressive Leasing attributable to its reduction in the number of employees during the second half of 2022 as part of its restructuring and cost cutting initiatives. Personnel costs attributable to Four and other strategic businesses also decreased by $0.1 million as compared to the same period in 2022. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $2.1 million at Vive primarily due to increased salaries and wages for new and existing employees.Stock-based compensation increased $5.2 million compared to 2022, consisting of increases of $3.6 million at Progressive Leasing, $1.0 million at Four and other strategic businesses, and $0.6 million at Vive. The lower stock-based compensation in 2022 was the result of: (i) the Company determining in the second quarter of 2022 that performance stock units that had been granted to Four executives were no longer probable of being earned resulting in lower expense in 2022 compared to 2023; (ii) the reversal of the stock-based compensation expense for performance stock units granted in 2022 that were tied to the performance of Progressive Leasing, based upon the Company's determination that those performance units were no longer probable of being earned; and (iii) other stock-based forfeitures related to the Progressive Leasing restructuring program. During 2023, the estimated payout of performance stock units granted in 2023 was increased based on revisions to the Company's forecasted results, further increasing the stock-based compensation expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.Restructuring expense decreased $7.0 million primarily due to a decline in restructuring activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, restructuring costs were primarily related to employee severance within Progressive Leasing. For the same period in 2022, restructuring costs included a higher amount of employee severance within Progressive Leasing, in addition to operating lease right-of-use asset impairment charges related to the relocation of the Vive corporate headquarters and a reduction of Progressive Leasing call center office space.30Other Costs and ExpensesDepreciation of lease merchandise. Depreciation of lease merchandise decreased by 11.5% during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the size of Progressive Leasing's lease portfolio, resulting from tightening of its decisioning in mid-2022 and decreased consumer demand for many of the leasable products offered by Progressive Leasing's retail partners. As a percentage of total lease revenues and fees, depreciation of lease merchandise decreased to 67.7% from 70.4% in the prior year period, primarily due to improved customer payment activity and lower early buyouts in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022.Provision for lease merchandise write-offs. The provision for lease merchandise write-offs decreased $39.4 million due to a reduction in the size of Progressive Leasing's lease portfolio during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022. The provision for lease merchandise write-offs as a percentage of lease revenues decreased to 6.5% during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 from 8.1% in the same period in 2022. The decrease in the provision was a result of improved customer payment activity and lower write-offs due to the Company tightening its lease decisioning in mid-2022. Given the significant economic uncertainty resulting from the rate of the increase in inflation, rising interest rates, the resumption of student loan payments in October 2023, and the potential effects of such developments on Progressive Leasing's POS partners, customers, and business going forward, a high level of estimation was involved in determining the allowance as of September 30, 2023. Actual lease merchandise write-offs could differ materially from the allowance for those write-offs.Impairment of Goodwill.

Factors impacting the change in earnings before income tax expense for each reporting segment are discussed above.31Income Tax Expense Income tax expense increased to $47.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to $31.9 million in the prior year comparable period due to higher earnings before income tax expense compared to the same period in the prior year, partially offset by the non-deductible goodwill impairment loss recognized for Four in the third quarter of 2022. The effective tax rate was 28.3% during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to 33.7% in the same period in 2022. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by the non-deductible goodwill impairment loss for Four of $10.2 million that occurred in 2022, and a favorable change in the discrete income tax expense recognized for stock-based compensation in 2023.32Overview of Financial PositionThe major changes in the condensed consolidated balance sheet from December 31, 2022 to September 30, 2023 include: •Cash and cash equivalents increased $162.9 million to $294.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For additional information, refer to the ""Liquidity and Capital Resources"" section below. •Lease merchandise, net of accumulated depreciation and allowances, decreased $126.8 million due primarily to a 24.4% decrease in Progressive Leasing's GMV for the third quarter of 2023 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022.•Deferred tax liability decreased $32.4 million due primarily to a decline in the temporary book-to-tax depreciation difference of lease merchandise resulting from the decline in merchandise on lease as of the third quarter of 2023, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, and the reduction of federal bonus depreciation from 100% in 2022 to 80% in 2023.33Liquidity and Capital ResourcesGeneralWe expect that our primary capital requirements will consist of:•Reinvesting in our business, including buying merchandise for the operations of Progressive Leasing. Because we believe Progressive Leasing will continue to grow over the long-term, we expect that the need for additional lease merchandise will remain a major capital requirement; •Making merger and acquisition investment(s) to further broaden our product offerings; and•Returning excess cash to shareholders through periodically repurchasing stock.Other capital requirements include (i) expenditures related to software development; (ii) expenditures related to our corporate operating activities; (iii) personnel expenditures; (iv) income tax payments; (v) funding of loans receivable for Vive; and (vi) servicing our outstanding debt obligations. Our capital requirements have been financed through:•cash flows from operations;•private debt offerings;•bank debt; and•stock offerings.As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $294.8 million of cash, $350.0 million of availability under the Revolving Facility, and $600.0 million of indebtedness.Cash Provided by Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities was $292.5 million and $283.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The $9.3 million increase in operating cash flows was primarily driven by a $174.3 million decrease in purchases of lease merchandise compared to the same period in 2022, changes in certain working capital accounts, and an increase in interest income resulting from an increase in deposits in higher yield accounts. These increases to cash inflows were partially offset by a $154.7 million decrease in lease revenue resulting from a lower lease portfolio and a $45.7 million increase in cash paid for income taxes. Other changes in cash provided by operating activities are discussed above in our discussion of results for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.Cash Used in Investing ActivitiesCash used in investing activities was $18.8 million and $39.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The $21.1 million decrease in investing cash outflows was primarily the result of a $11.9 million increase in proceeds from loans receivable in addition to a $8.8 million decrease in cash outflows for investments in loans receivable.Cash Used in Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities was $110.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to $191.5 million during the same period in 2022. Cash used in financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily for the Company's repurchase of $108.3 million of its common stock, compared to $187.4 million of share repurchases in the same period in the prior year.34Share RepurchasesWe purchase our stock in the market from time to time as authorized by our Board of Directors. On November 3, 2021, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program that replaced the previous $300 million repurchase program. The Company repurchased 3,587,361 shares for $108.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. That amount does not include any excise tax that may be assessed on those repurchases. As of September 30, 2023, we had the authority to purchase additional shares up to our remaining authorization limit of $229.0 million.Debt FinancingOn November 24, 2020, the Company entered into a credit agreement with a consortium of lenders providing for a $350.0 million senior revolving credit facility, under which revolving borrowings became available on the date of the completion of the separation and distribution transaction pursuant to which our former Aaron's Business segment was spun-off into a separate publicly-traded company, and under which all borrowings and commitments will mature or terminate on November 24, 2025.As of September 30, 2023, the Company had no outstanding balance and $350.0 million remaining available for borrowings on the Revolving Facility. The Revolving Facility includes an uncommitted incremental facility increase option (""Incremental Facilities"") which, subject to certain terms and conditions, permits the Company at any time prior to the maturity date to request an increase in extensions of credit available thereunder by an aggregate additional principal amount of up to $300.0 million. Our Revolving Facility contains certain financial covenants, which include requirements that the Company maintain ratios of (i) total net debt to EBITDA of no more than 2.50:1.00 and (ii) consolidated interest coverage of no less than 3.00:1.00. The Company will be in default under the Revolving Facility if it fails to comply with these covenants, and all borrowings outstanding may become due immediately. Additionally, under the Revolving Facility, if the total net debt to EBITDA, as defined by the Revolving Facility, exceeds 1.25, the revolver becomes fully secured for the remaining duration of the Revolving Facility term. As of June 30, 2022, the Company exceeded the 1.25 total net debt to EBITDA ratio and the Revolving Facility became fully secured. At September 30, 2023, we were in compliance with the financial covenants set forth in the Revolving Facility and believe that we will continue to be in compliance in the future.On November 26, 2021, the Company entered into an indenture in connection with its offering of $600 million aggregate principal amount of its senior unsecured notes due 2029 (the ""Senior Notes""). The Senior Notes were issued at 100.0% of their par value with a stated fixed annual interest rate of 6.00%. Interest accrues on the outstanding balance and is payable semi-annually. The Senior Notes are general unsecured obligations of the Company and are guaranteed by certain of the Company's existing and future domestic subsidiaries. The indenture discussed above contains various other covenants and obligations to which the Company and its subsidiaries are subject while the Senior Notes are outstanding. The covenants in the indenture may limit the extent to which, or the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to, among other things: (i) incur additional debt and guarantee debt; (ii) pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem capital stock; (iii) prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt; (iv) issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities; (v) make loans and investments; (vi) sell assets; (vii) incur liens; (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates; (ix) enter into agreements restricting the ability of the Company’s subsidiaries to pay dividends; and (x) consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of the Company’s assets. The indenture also contains customary events of default for transactions of this type and amount. We were in compliance with these covenants at September 30, 2023 and believe that we will continue to be in compliance in the future. CommitmentsIncome TaxesDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we made net tax payments of $76.8 million. Within the next three months, we anticipate making estimated tax payments of $21.2 million for United States federal income taxes and state income taxes. Deferred income tax liabilities as of September 30, 2023 were $104.8 million. Deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their respective book basis, which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the liabilities are settled at their reported financial statement amounts. The results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods.35LeasesWe lease management and information technology space for corporate functions as well as call center space and storage space for our hub facilities under operating leases expiring at various times through 2027. Our corporate and call center leases contain renewal options for additional periods ranging from three to five years. We also lease transportation vehicles under operating leases which generally expire during the next three years. We expect that most leases will be renewed or replaced by other leases in the normal course of business. Contractual Obligations and CommitmentsFuture interest payments on the Company's variable-rate debt are based on a rate per annum equal to, at our option, (i) the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR"") plus a margin within the range of 1.5% to 2.5% for revolving loans, based on total leverage, or (ii) the administrative agent's base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.5% to 1.5%, as specified in the agreement. Future interest payments related to our Revolving Facility are based on the borrowings outstanding at that time. Future interest payments may be different depending on future borrowing activity and interest rates. The Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Facility as of September 30, 2023.On November 26, 2021, the Company issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes that bear a fixed annual interest rate of 6.00%. Interest accrues on the outstanding balance and is payable semi-annually. The Senior Notes will mature on November 15, 2029.The Company has no long-term commitments to purchase merchandise nor does it have significant purchase agreements that specify minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months.Unfunded Lending CommitmentsThe Company, through its Vive business, had unconditionally cancellable unfunded lending commitments totaling approximately $531.2 million and $513.7 million as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, that do not give rise to revenues and cash flows. These unfunded commitments arise in the ordinary course of business from credit card agreements with individual cardholders that give them the ability to borrow, against unused amounts, up to the maximum credit limit assigned to their account. While these unfunded amounts represented the total available unused lines of credit, the Company does not anticipate that all cardholders will utilize their entire available line at any given point in time. Commitments to extend unsecured credit are agreements to lend to a cardholder so long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.Critical Accounting PoliciesRefer to the 2022 Annual Report.Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements, including pronouncements that were adopted in the current year.",47975,mgmt,20231025,2023,10Q,real_textdata_2023

RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A — Risk Factors in the 2022 Form 10-K, which could materially affect the business, financial condition, cash flows or future results of Pinnacle West and APS. The risks described in the 2022 Form 10-K are not the only risks facing Pinnacle West and APS. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect the business, financial condition, cash flows and/or operating results of Pinnacle West and APS. The risk factor below is an update to our 2022 Form 10-K.The impact of wildfires could negatively affect APS’s results of operations.Wildfires have the potential to affect communities within APS’s service territory and the surrounding areas, as well as APS’s vast network of electric transmission and distribution lines and facilities. The potential likelihood of wildfires has increased due to many of the same weather and climate change impacts existing in Arizona as those that led to catastrophic wildfires in California. The continued expansion of the wildland urban interface has also increased wildfire risk to surrounding communities. While we proactively take steps to mitigate wildfire risk in the areas of our electrical assets, wildfire risk is always present due to APS’s expansive service territory. APS could be held liable for damages incurred as a result of wildfires if it was determined that they were caused by or enhanced due to any fault of APS. Wildfires could also lead to volatility in the market price of our common stock and increased risks of our credit ratings being downgraded and significant financial distress. Furthermore, any damage caused to our assets, loss of service to our customers, or liability imposed as a result of wildfires could negatively impact APS’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.",2028,rf,20231102,2023,10Q,real_textdata_2023

Risk Factors” of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, and include, but are not limited to: •the sensitivity of our business to economic and financial market conditions generally and economic conditions in CECO’s service areas; •dependence on fixed price contracts and the risks associated therewith, including actual costs exceeding estimates and method of accounting for revenue; •the effect of growth on CECO’s infrastructure, resources and existing sales; •the ability to expand operations in both new and existing markets; •the potential for contract delay or cancellation as a result of on-going or worsening supply chain challenges; •liabilities arising from faulty services or products that could result in significant professional or product liability, warranty or other claims; 28 •changes in or developments with respect to any litigation or investigation; •failure to meet timely completion or performance standards that could result in higher cost and reduced profits or, in some cases, losses on projects; •the potential for fluctuations in prices for manufactured components and raw materials, including as a result of tariffs and surcharges, and rising energy costs; •inflationary pressures relating to rising raw material costs and the cost of labor; •the substantial amount of debt incurred in connection with our strategic transactions and our ability to repay or refinance it or incur additional debt in the future; •the impact of federal, state or local government regulations; •our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock and the amounts and timing of repurchases, if any; •our ability to successfully realize the expected benefits of our restructuring program; •economic and political conditions generally; •our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and realize the synergies from strategic transactions; •unpredictability and severity of catastrophic events, including cybersecurity threats, acts of terrorism or outbreak of war or hostilities or public health crises, as well as management’s response to any of the aforementioned factors; and •our ability to remediate our material weaknesses, or any other material weakness that we may identify in the future that could result in material misstatements in our financial statements. Many of these risks are beyond management’s ability to control or predict. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any related assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material aspects from those currently anticipated. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements as they speak only to our views as of the date the statement is made. Furthermore, the forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. Except as required under the federal securities laws or the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), we undertake no obligation to update or review any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The risk factors that were disclosed in “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 are hereby supplemented to include the following: We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to develop and maintain adequate internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and materially and adversely affect our business. Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to include in each of our Annual Reports on Form 10-K a report containing our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and an attestation report of our independent auditor. These laws, rules and regulations continue to evolve and could become increasingly stringent in the future. We have undertaken actions to enhance our ability to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, including, but not limited to, the engagement of consultants, the documentation of existing controls and the implementation of new controls or modification of existing controls as deemed appropriate. We continue to devote substantial time and resources to the documentation and testing of our controls, and to plan for and the implementation of remedial efforts in those instances where remediation is indicated. As disclosed in Item 4. “Controls and Procedures” in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we have material weaknesses in our control environment with regard to management’s review of revenue recognition for contracts and balance sheet reconciliations. These material weaknesses could result in a misstatement of account balances or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. To address these material weaknesses, we have developed a remediation plan that includes reinforcing the importance of adherence to Company policies regarding control performance and related documentation with control owners, strengthening existing training programs for control owners, and developing monitoring activities to validate the performance of controls by control owners. As of September 30, 2023, these remediation efforts are ongoing. The actions that we are taking are subject to ongoing senior management review, as well as Audit Committee oversight. We will not be able to conclude whether the steps we are taking will fully remediate the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting until we have completed our remediation efforts and subsequent evaluation of their effectiveness. Until these material weaknesses are remediated, we plan to continue to perform additional analyses and other procedures to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. If we continue to have material weaknesses in our internal controls, or, if we fail to develop and maintain adequate internal controls in the future, including remediating any material weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal controls, we could be subject to regulatory actions, civil or criminal penalties or stockholder litigation. In addition, failure to maintain adequate internal controls could result in financial statements that do not accurately reflect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We believe that the out-of-pocket costs, the diversion of management’s attention from running our day-to-day operations and operational changes caused by the need to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 will continue to be significant.",7014,rf,20231107,2023,10Q,real_textdata_2023

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 reflect the consolidated operations of the Company and its subsidiaries. CECO Environmental Corp. (“CECO,” “we,” “us,” or the “Company”) is a leading environmentally focused, diversified industrial company, serving the broad landscape of industrial air, industrial water and energy transition markets globally providing innovative technology and application expertise. CECO helps companies grow their business with safe, clean, and more efficient solutions that help protect people, the environment and industrial equipment. CECO solutions improve air and water quality, optimize emissions management, and increase the energy and process efficiency for highly engineered applications in power generation, midstream and downstream hydrocarbon processing and transport, chemical processing, electric vehicle production, polysilicon fabrication, semiconductor and electronics production, battery production and recycling, specialty metals, aluminum and steel production, beverage can manufacturing, and industrial and produced water and wastewater treatment, and a wide range of other industrial end markets. Market Pressures The senior management team monitors and manages the Company’s ability to operate effectively as the result of market pressures. In particular, we are currently experiencing challenges in obtaining certain raw materials and labor on a timely basis at a reasonable cost. We expect these supply chain challenges and cost impacts to continue for the foreseeable future. Although we have taken mitigating actions, including securing additional raw materials from existing and alternate suppliers, to minimize supply chain disruptions, we cannot guarantee that these efforts will continue to be successful. In this event, our business, results and financial condition could be adversely affected. Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). These GAAP financial statements include certain charges the Company believes are not indicative of its core ongoing operational performance. As a result, the Company provides financial information in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis that was not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to the information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company provides this non-GAAP financial information because the Company’s management utilizes it to evaluate its ongoing financial performance and the Company believes it provides greater transparency to investors as supplemental information to its GAAP results. The Company has provided the non-GAAP financial measures of non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin as a result of items that the Company believes are not indicative of its ongoing operations. These include transactions associated with the Company’s acquisitions and the items described below in “Consolidated Results.” The Company believes that evaluation of its financial performance compared with prior and future periods can be enhanced by a presentation of results that exclude the impact of these items. The Company has incurred substantial expense and income associated with acquisitions. While the Company cannot predict the exact timing or amounts of such charges, it does expect to treat the financial impact of these transactions as special items in its future presentation of non-GAAP results. 22 Results of Operations Consolidated Results Our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 are as follows: Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, (in millions, except ratios) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net sales $ 149.4 $ 108.4 $ 391.1 $ 306.2 Cost of sales 106.3 76.0 273.3 215.7 Gross profit $ 43.1 $ 32.4 $ 117.8 $ 90.5 Percent of sales 28.8 % 29.9 % 30.1 % 29.6 % Selling and administrative expenses 30.3 25.1 86.1 66.8 Percent of sales 20.3 % 23.2 % 22.0 % 21.8 % Amortization and earnout expenses 2.0 2.0 6.0 4.9 Acquisition and integration expenses 1.4 1.3 2.2 3.8 Executive transition expenses 1.3 1.2 1.4 1.2 Restructuring expenses 0.2 — 0.2 0.1 Operating income $ 7.9 $ 2.8 $ 21.9 $ 13.7 Operating margin 5.3 % 2.6 % 5.6 % 4.5 % To compare operating performance between the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company has adjusted GAAP operating income to exclude (1) amortization of intangible assets, earnout and retention expenses, (2) acquisition and integration expenses, which include legal, accounting, and other expenses, (3) executive transition expenses, including fees and expenses incurred in the search for and hiring of new executives and (4) restructuring expenses primarily relating to severance, facility exits, and associated legal expenses.

The increase is led by an increase of $22.4 million in our thermal acoustics business and $14.5 million in our separation, filtration and industrial water businesses. Of the $145.5 million in orders booked during the three months ended September 30, 2023, $17.1 million is attributable to acquisitions that have occurred during the preceding twelve month period. Orders booked increased $78.2 million, or 21%, to $454.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared with $376.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase is led by increases of $25.7 million in our thermal acoustics business, $23.5 million in our separation, filtration and industrial water businesses and $21.8 million in our emissions management business. Of the $454.4 million in orders booked during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, $29.7 million is attributable to acquisitions that have occurred during the preceding twelve month period. Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2023 increased $41.0 million, or 37.8%, to $149.4 million compared with $108.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The increase is broad-based, led by an increase of $26.3 million in our separation, filtration and industrial water businesses. Approximately 89%, or $133.6 million, of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2023 is attributable to organic revenue, defined as revenue recorded subsequent to the twelve month period post-acquisition date. 23 Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased $84.9 million, or 27.7%, to $391.1 million compared with $306.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase is broad-based, led by increases of $54.1 million in separation, filtration, and industrial water businesses, and $14.9 million in our thermal acoustics business. Approximately 91% or $354.8 million, of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is attributable to organic revenue. Gross profit increased $10.7 million, or 33.0%, to $43.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared with $32.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2022. The increase in gross profit is primarily attributable to higher organic sales as described above, operating performance and acquisitions of businesses with favorable margins. Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased by 100 basis points to 28.8% in the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared with 29.9% in the three months ended September 30, 2022. Gross profit increased $27.3 million, or 30.2%, to $117.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared with $90.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase in gross profit is primarily attributable to higher organic sales as described above, favorable project margin mix and acquisitions of businesses with favorable margins. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased by 60 basis points to 30.2% in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared with 29.6% in the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Selling and administrative expenses were $30.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared with $25.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The increase is primarily attributable to acquisitions during the prior and current year, and increased sales and engineering headcount to support our growth, execute against our backlog, and expand our global footprint. Selling and administrative expenses were $86.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared with $66.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase is primarily attributable to acquisitions during the prior and current year, a $2.5 million favorable insurance settlement in the prior year, and increased investments to support our growth and expand our global footprint. Amortization and earnout expense was $2.0 million for each of the three months ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022. Amortization and earnout expense was $6.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared with $4.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase in expense is attributable to an increase of $0.7 million in earnout expense and an increase of $0.4 million in definite lived asset amortization due to increased intangible assets attributable to current and prior year acquisitions. Operating income increased $5.1 million to $7.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared with operating income of $2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The increase in operating income is primarily attributable to higher organic sales. Operating income increased $8.2 million to $21.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared with operating income of $13.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase in operating income is primarily attributable to higher organic sales. Non-GAAP operating income was $12.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared with $7.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022. Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of sales increased 190 basis points to 8.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2023 from 6.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2022. Non-GAAP operating income was $31.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared with $23.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of sales increased 40 basis points to 8.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2023 from 7.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Interest expense increased to $3.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared with interest expense of $1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to increased debt balances and rising interest rates. Interest expense increased to $9.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared with interest expense of $3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to increased debt balances and rising interest rates. Income tax expense was $0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared with income tax expense of $0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022. Income tax expense was $1.6 million for the nine months ended 24 September 30, 2023 compared with income tax expense of $3.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was 13.6% compared with 12.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 13.4% compared with 25.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The effective income tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 differ from the United States federal statutory rate. Our effective tax rate is affected by certain other permanent differences, including state income taxes, non-deductible incentive stock-based compensation, and differences in tax rates among the jurisdictions in which we operate. Business Segments The Company’s operations are organized and reviewed by management along its product lines or end market that the segment serves and are presented in two reportable segments. The results of the segments are reviewed through “Income from operations” on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, (in thousands) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net Sales (less intra- and inter-segment sales) Engineered Systems segment $ 105,540 $ 65,630 $ 267,516 $ 189,938 Industrial Process Solutions segment 43,850 42,784 123,618 116,287 Total net sales $ 149,390 $ 108,414 $ 391,134 $ 306,225 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, (in thousands) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Income from Operations Engineered Systems segment $ 15,759 $ 8,991 $ 39,601 $ 24,467 Industrial Process Solutions segment 5,586 5,226 15,769 14,847 Corporate and Other(1) (13,492 ) (11,444 ) (33,453 ) (25,591 ) Total income from operations $ 7,853 $ 2,773 $ 21,917 $ 13,723 (1) Includes corporate compensation, professional services, information technology and other general and administrative corporate expenses. Engineered Systems Segment Our Engineered Systems segment net sales increased $39.9 million to $105.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared with $65.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The increase is led by an increase of $26.3 million in separation, filtration, and industrial water businesses. Approximately 86%, or $90.2 million, of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2023 is attributable to organic revenue. Our Engineered Systems segment net sales increased $77.6 million to $267.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared with $189.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase is led by an increase of $54.1 million in separation, filtration, and industrial water businesses. Approximately 87%, or $233.6 million, of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is attributable to organic revenue. Operating income for the Engineered Systems segment increased $6.8 million to $15.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared with $9.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The increase is primarily attributable to increased organic sales, partially offset by an increase in direct costs. Operating income for the Engineered Systems segment increased $15.1 million to $39.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared with $24.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase is primarily attributable to increased organic sales, partially offset by an increase in direct costs. Industrial Process Solutions Segment Our Industrial Process Solutions segment net sales increased $1.1 million to $43.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared with $42.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The entirety of the increase represents organic growth. 25 Our Industrial Process Solutions segment net sales increased $7.3 million to $123.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared with $116.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase of $4.8 million in our fluid handling business. Approximately 98%, or $121.1 million, of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is attributable to organic revenue. Operating income for the Industrial Process Solutions segment increased $0.4 million to $5.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared with $5.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The increase is primarily attributable to increased sales, partially offset by an increase in direct costs. Operating income for the Industrial Process Solutions segment increased $1.0 million to $15.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared with $14.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase is primarily attributable to increased sales, partially offset by an increase in direct costs. Corporate and Other Segment Operating expense for the Corporate and Other segment increased $2.1 million to $13.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared with $11.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The increase is primarily attributable to investments made to support growth inclusive of acquisition and integration expenses, and inflationary increases for wages and services. Operating expense for the Corporate and Other segment increased $7.9 million to $33.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared with $25.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase is primarily attributable to investments made to support growth inclusive of acquisition and integration expenses, inflationary increases for wages and services, and a favorable insurance settlement of $2.5 million in the prior year period. Backlog Backlog (i.e., unfulfilled or remaining performance obligations) represents the sales we expect to recognize for our products and services for which control has not yet transferred to the customer. Backlog increased to $394.0 million as of September 30, 2023 from $311.7 million as of December 31, 2022, with $57.2 million, or 69.5%, due to organic growth. Our customers may have the right to cancel a given order. Historically, cancellations have not been common. Backlog is adjusted on a quarterly basis for adjustments in foreign currency exchange rates. Substantially all backlog is expected to be delivered within 12 to 18 months. Backlog is not defined by GAAP and our methodology for calculating backlog may not be consistent with methodologies used by other companies.

REAL_1045_01_rf_2025_0024,1045,01,1045:01,"Item 1A. Risk Factors21 Item 1A. Risk Factors, ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSBelow are certain risk factors that may affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, or the trading price of our common stock or other securities. We caution the reader that these risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risks and uncertainties, nor can it assess the extent to which any of the risk factors below or any such new risks and uncertainties, or any combination thereof, may impact our business.Risks Related to our Business and IndustryDownturns in economic conditions could adversely affect our business. Due to the discretionary nature of business and leisure travel spending and the highly competitive nature of the airline industry, our revenues are heavily influenced by the condition of the U.S. economy and economies in other regions of the world. Unfavorable conditions in these broader economies have resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased passenger demand for air travel, changes in booking practices and related reactions by our competitors, all of which in turn have had, and may have in the future, a strong negative effect on our business. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic and associated decline in economic activity and increase in unemployment levels had a severe and prolonged effect on the global economy generally and, in turn, resulted in a prolonged period of depressed demand for air travel. In addition, a rapid economic expansion following the height of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant inflationary pressures and volatility in certain currencies, which have increased our costs for aircraft fuel, wages and benefits and other goods and services we require to operate our business, as well as increasing the interest expense on our variable-rate indebtedness. Furthermore, our efforts to regain travel revenue share, including corporate and travel agency revenue share, may not succeed and competitive pressures and shifts in corporate travel preferences could impede our ability to recapture this revenue, negatively affecting our business strategy and financial results.We will need to obtain sufficient financing or other capital to operate successfully.Our business plan contemplates continued significant investments related to our fleet, improving the experience of our customers and updating our facilities. Significant capital resources will be required to execute this plan. We estimate that, based on our commitments as of December 31, 2024, our planned aggregate expenditures for aircraft purchase commitments and certain engines on a consolidated basis for calendar years 2025 through 2029 would be approximately $17.1 billion. We may also require financing to refinance maturing obligations and to provide liquidity to fund other corporate requirements. Accordingly, we will need substantial liquidity, financing or other capital resources to finance such aircraft and engines and meet such other liquidity needs. It may be difficult for us to raise additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all, due to, among other factors: our substantial level of existing indebtedness, particularly following transactions we completed in response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; our non-investment grade credit rating; volatile or otherwise unfavorable market conditions; and the availability of assets to use as collateral for loans or other indebtedness. If we are unable to arrange any such required financing at customary advance rates and on terms and conditions acceptable to us, we may need to use cash from operations or cash on hand to purchase aircraft and engines or fund our other corporate requirements, or may seek to negotiate deferrals for such aircraft and engines with the applicable manufacturers or otherwise defer corporate obligations. Depending on numerous factors applicable at the time we seek capital, many of which are out of our control, such as the state of the domestic and global economies, the capital and credit markets’ view of our prospects and the airline industry in general, and the general availability of debt and equity capital, the financing or other capital resources that we will need may not be available to us, or may be available only on onerous terms and conditions. Furthermore, we hold significant balances of cash and short-term investments, including as necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations, some of which are held in deposit accounts at commercial banks in excess of the government-provided deposit insurance. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining financing or other needed sources of capital to operate successfully or to fund our committed expenditures. An inability to obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms would limit our ability to execute necessary capital projects and would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our high level of debt and other obligations may limit our ability to fund general corporate requirements and obtain additional financing, may limit our flexibility in responding to competitive developments and may cause our business to be vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions.We have significant amounts of indebtedness and other financial obligations, including pension obligations, obligations to make future payments on flight equipment and property leases related to airport and other facilities, and substantial non-cancelable obligations under aircraft and related spare engine purchase agreements. Moreover, currently a very significant portion of our assets are pledged to secure our indebtedness. Our substantial indebtedness and other 21Table of Contentsobligations, which are generally greater than the indebtedness and other obligations of our competitors, could have important consequences. For example, they may:•make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness;•limit our ability to obtain additional funding for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments and general corporate purposes, and adversely affect the terms on which such funding can be obtained;•require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our liquidity or cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness and other obligations, thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes;•make us more vulnerable to economic downturns, industry conditions and catastrophic external events, particularly relative to competitors with lower relative levels of financial leverage;•significantly constrain our ability to respond, or respond quickly, to unexpected disruptions in our own operations, the U.S. or global economies, or the businesses in which we operate, or to take advantage of opportunities that would improve our business, operations, or competitive position versus other airlines;•limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions;•bear interest at floating rates, subjecting us to volatility in interest expenses as interest rates fluctuate;•contain financial covenants, including the requirement to maintain an aggregate of at least $2.0 billion of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and amounts available to be drawn under revolving credit facilities, as well as collateral coverage ratios and peak debt service coverage ratios;•impact availability of borrowings under revolving lines of credit; and•contain restrictive covenants that could, among other things:◦limit our ability to merge, consolidate, sell assets, incur additional indebtedness, issue preferred stock, make investments and/or pay dividends; and◦if breached, result in an event of default under our other indebtedness.In addition, during the COVID-19 pandemic we were required to obtain a significant amount of additional financing from a variety of sources and we cannot guarantee that we will not need to obtain additional financing in the future. Such financing may include the issuance of additional unsecured or secured debt securities, equity securities and equity-linked securities as well as additional bilateral and syndicated secured and/or unsecured credit facilities, among other items. There can be no assurance as to the timing of any such financing transactions, which may be in the near term, or that we will be able to obtain such additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. Any such actions may be material in nature, could result in the incurrence and issuance of significant additional indebtedness or equity and could impose significant covenants and restrictions to which we are not currently subject. Moreover, as a result of the financing activities we undertook in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of financings with respect to which such covenants and provisions apply has increased, thereby subjecting us to more substantial risk of cross-default and cross-acceleration in the event of breach, and additional covenants and provisions could become binding on us should we seek additional liquidity in the future. The obligations discussed above, including those imposed as a result of any additional financings we may undertake, could also impact our ability to obtain additional financing, if needed, and our flexibility in the conduct of our business, and could materially adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.Further, a substantial amount of our long-term indebtedness bears interest at floating interest rates, which tend to fluctuate based on general short-term interest rates, rates set by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks, the supply of and demand for credit in treasury repurchase or other markets and general economic conditions. We have not hedged our interest rate exposure with respect to our floating rate debt. Accordingly, our interest expense for any particular period will fluctuate based on the relevant benchmark rate and other variable interest rates. In response to rising inflation which coincided with a rapid rebound of economic activity as governments lifted restrictions and economies reopened following the COVID-19 pandemic, central banks around the world—including the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England—undertook a cycle of raising interest rates, which has consequently 22Table of Contentsincreased the interest we pay on our floating-rate indebtedness. To the extent the interest rates applicable to our floating rate debt remain elevated or increase, our interest expense will increase, in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs, and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected. We have significant pension and other postretirement benefit funding obligations, which may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.Our pension funding obligations are significant. The amount of our pension funding obligations will depend on the performance of investments held in trust by the pension plans, interest rates for determining liabilities and actuarial experience. We also have significant obligations for retiree medical and other postretirement benefits. Additionally, we participate in the IAM National Pension Fund (the IAM Pension Fund). The funding status of the IAM Pension Fund is subject to the risk that other employers may not meet their obligations, which under certain circumstances could cause our obligations to increase. On March 29, 2019, the actuary for the IAM Pension Fund certified that the fund was in “endangered” status despite reporting a funded status of over 80%. Additionally, the IAM Pension Fund’s Board voluntarily elected to enter into “critical” status on April 17, 2019. Upon entry into critical status, the IAM Pension Fund was required by law to adopt a rehabilitation plan aimed at restoring the financial health of the pension plan and did so on April 17, 2019 (the Rehabilitation Plan). Under the Rehabilitation Plan, American was subject to an immaterial contribution surcharge, which ceased to apply on June 14, 2019 upon American’s mandatory adoption of a contribution schedule under the Rehabilitation Plan. The contribution schedule requires 2.5% annual increases to its contribution rate. This contribution schedule will remain in effect through the earlier of December 31, 2031 or the date the IAM Pension Fund emerges from critical status. Furthermore, if we were to withdraw from the IAM Pension Fund, if the IAM Pension Fund were to terminate, or if the IAM Pension Fund were to undergo a mass withdrawal, we could be subject to liability as imposed by law.If our financial condition worsens, provisions in our credit card processing and other commercial agreements may adversely affect our liquidity.We have agreements with companies that process customer credit card transactions for the sale of air travel and other services. These agreements allow these credit card processing companies, under certain conditions (including, with respect to certain agreements, our failure to maintain certain levels of liquidity), to hold an amount of our cash (referred to as a holdback) equal to some or all of the advance ticket sales that have been processed by that credit card processor, but for which we have not yet provided the air transportation. Additionally, such credit card processing companies may require cash or other collateral reserves to be established. These holdback requirements can be implemented at the discretion of the credit card processing companies upon the occurrence of specific events, including material adverse changes in our financial condition or the triggering of a liquidity covenant. The imposition of holdback requirements, up to and including 100% of relevant advanced ticket sales, would materially reduce our liquidity. Likewise, other of our commercial agreements contain provisions that allow counterparties to impose less-favorable terms, including the acceleration of amounts due, in the event of material adverse changes in our financial condition. For example, we maintain certain letters of credit as well as insurance- and surety-related agreements under which counterparties may require collateral, including cash collateral.The loss of key personnel who we depend on to operate our business, or the inability to attract, develop and retain additional qualified personnel could adversely affect our business.We believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to attract, develop and retain highly qualified management, technical and other personnel. We may not be successful in attracting, developing or retaining key personnel or other highly qualified personnel. In addition, competition for skilled personnel has intensified and may continue to intensify if overall industry capacity continues to increase and/or we were to incur attrition at levels higher than we have historically. Any inability to attract, develop and retain significant numbers of qualified management and other personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.23Table of ContentsOur business has been and will continue to be materially affected by many changing economic, geopolitical, commercial, regulatory and other conditions beyond our control, including global events that affect travel behavior, and our results of operations could be volatile and fluctuate materially due to changes in such conditions. Our business, results of operations and financial condition have been and will continue to be affected by many changing economic, geopolitical, commercial, regulatory and other conditions beyond our control, including, among others:•actual or potential changes in international, national, regional and local economic, business and financial conditions, including recession, inflation and elevated interest rates;•the occurrence of wars or other conflicts and escalations thereof, terrorist attacks and geopolitical instability;•changes in consumer disposable income, preferences, perceptions, spending patterns and demographic trends;•changes in the competitive environment due to industry consolidation, changes in airline alliance affiliations, changes in our commercial strategy or that of our competitors and other factors;•delays in scheduled aircraft deliveries, unexpected grounding of aircraft or aircraft engines whether by regulators or by us, or other loss of anticipated fleet capacity, and failure of new aircraft or aircraft-related equipment to receive regulatory approval, be produced or otherwise perform as and when expected;•actual or potential disruptions to the U.S. National Airspace System (the ATC system);•increases in costs of safety, security and environmental measures or costs of complying with new or more onerous consumer protection laws or regulations;•increases in costs related to meeting our climate goals or obligations, including in respect of the costs to be incurred to migrate to increased use of SAF in lieu of conventional aviation fuel;•outbreaks of diseases or other public health or safety concerns that affect travel behavior, such as occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic; and•adverse weather and natural disasters, including increases in frequency, severity or duration of such disasters, and related costs caused by more severe weather due to climate change.A potential resurgence of COVID-19, or an outbreak of another contagious disease, such as has occurred in the past with the Ebola virus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, H1N1 influenza virus, avian flu, Zika virus or any other similar illness, if it were to become associated with air travel or persist for an extended period, could materially affect the airline industry and us by reducing revenues and adversely impacting our operations and passengers’ travel behavior. Governments could implement travel restrictions, including testing regimes, “stay at home” and quarantine orders, limitations on public gatherings, cancellation of public events or take or mandate other actions which could result in significant declines in demand for both domestic and international business and leisure travel. There can be no assurance that any mitigating actions we take in response will be sufficient to avert a deterioration in our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a result of these or other conditions beyond our control, our results of operations could be volatile and subject to rapid and unexpected change.Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated changes in business practices which may persist. For example, businesses and other travelers may continue to forego air travel in favor of remote or flexible working policies and communication alternatives such as videoconferencing. In addition, businesses may seek to reduce travel costs by requiring the purchase of less expensive tickets, thereby potentially impacting our average revenue per available seat mile.In addition, due to generally weaker demand for air travel during the winter, our revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year could be weaker than revenues in the second and third quarters of the year.The airline industry is intensely competitive and dynamic.Our competitors include other major domestic airlines and foreign, regional and new entrant airlines, as well as joint ventures formed by some of these airlines, many of which have greater financial or other resources and/or lower cost structures than ours, as well as other forms of transportation, such as rail and private automobiles or alternatives to 24Table of Contentscommuting or business travel including remote or flexible working policies and communication alternatives such as videoconferencing. In many of our markets, we compete with at least one low-cost carrier (including so-called ultra-low-cost carriers). Our revenues are sensitive to the actions of other carriers in many areas, including pricing, scheduling, capacity, fees (including cancellation, change and baggage fees), amenities, loyalty benefits and promotions, which can have a substantial adverse impact not only on our revenues, but on overall industry revenues. These factors may become even more significant in periods when the industry experiences large losses (such as occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic), as airlines under financial stress, or in bankruptcy, may institute pricing or fee structures intended to attract more customers to achieve near-term survival at the expense of long-term viability.Low-cost carriers (including so-called ultra-low-cost carriers) have a profound impact on industry revenues. Using the advantage of low unit costs, these carriers offer lower fares in order to shift demand from larger, more established airlines, and represent significant competitors, particularly for customers who fly infrequently or are price sensitive and therefore tend not to be loyal to any one particular carrier. Many of these carriers, including several that have recently commenced operations, have announced growth strategies including commitments to acquire significant numbers of new aircraft for delivery in the next few years. These low-cost carriers are attempting to continue to increase their market share through growth and consolidation, and are expected to continue to have an impact on our revenues and overall performance. We and several other large network carriers have implemented “Basic Economy” fares designed to more effectively compete against low-cost carriers, but we cannot predict whether these initiatives will be successful. Low-cost carriers may also implement, and in some cases have implemented, changes to their strategies or business models that could, and in some cases have, put them in more direct competition with network carriers. While historically these carriers have provided competition in domestic markets, we have recently experienced new competition from low-cost carriers on international routes, including low-cost airlines executing international long-haul expansion strategies, a trend likely to continue, in particular with the planned introduction of long-range narrowbody aircraft in coming years. Additionally, other carriers focused on premium passenger travel are attempting to implement growth strategies. The actions of existing or future carriers, including those described above, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance.In certain instances, other air carriers are operating scheduled service with a business model that relies on the FAA Part 135, a regulatory environment that is generally less stringent than the rules applicable to our airline and similar airlines that operate under FAA Part 121 and which provides those airlines certain competitive advantages that Part 121 airlines cannot replicate. We have objected to the DOT and the TSA that the less stringent Part 135 rules were never intended as a basis for scheduled passenger service and that business model should not be permissible, and the agencies’ review is ongoing. While both the DOT and TSA are actively reviewing these operations, if they ultimately allow scheduled passenger service in any form under Part 135 and the actions of existing or future carriers using that business model, including those described above, it could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.We provide air travel internationally, directly as well as through joint businesses, strategic alliances, codeshare and similar arrangements to which we are a party. While our network is comprehensive, compared to some of our key global competitors, we generally have somewhat greater relative exposure to certain regions (for example, Latin America) and somewhat lower relative exposure to others (for example, Asia). Our financial performance relative to our key competitors will therefore be influenced significantly by macro-economic conditions in particular regions around the world and the relative exposure of our network to the markets in those regions, including the duration of any declines in demand for travel to specific regions as a result of health emergencies (such as during the COVID-19 pandemic), geopolitical instability or other factors, and the speed with which demand for travel to these regions returns.Our international service exposes us to foreign economies and the potential for reduced demand when any foreign country we serve suffers adverse local economic conditions or if governments restrict commercial air service to or from any of these markets. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a precipitous and prolonged decline in demand for air travel, in particular international travel, in part as a result of the imposition by the U.S. and foreign governments of restrictions on travel from certain regions. In addition, “open skies” agreements, which are now in place with a substantial number of countries around the world, provide international airlines with open access to U.S. markets, potentially subjecting us to increased competition on our international routes. See also “Our business is subject to extensive government regulation, which may result in increases in our costs, disruptions to our operations, limits on our operating flexibility, reductions in the demand for air travel, and competitive disadvantages.”To the extent alliances formed by our competitors can undertake activities that are not available to us, including as to regulatory approvals, access slots, gates and routes and other matters, our ability to effectively compete may be hindered. Our ability to attract and retain customers is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to offer our customers 25Table of Contentsconvenient access to desired markets. Our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain or obtain alliance and marketing relationships with other air carriers in desired markets.American has established a transatlantic joint business with British Airways, Aer Lingus, Iberia and Finnair, a transpacific joint business with Japan Airlines and a joint business relating to Australia and New Zealand with Qantas. We have also established a strategic alliance with Alaska Airlines relating to certain routes on the West Coast of the United States and a strategic alliance relating to the Middle East with Qatar Airways. Legal challenges to our joint businesses and strategic alliances could negatively impact our operations and equity value, disrupt our strategic plans and affect our ability to offer competitive services in key markets. In July 2010, in connection with a regulatory review related to our transatlantic joint business, we provided certain commitments to the EC regarding, among other things, the availability of take-off and landing slots at LHR or LGW airports. The commitments accepted by the EC were binding for 10 years. In anticipation of both the exit of the UK from the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit, and the expiry of the EC commitments in July 2020, the CMA, in October 2018, opened an investigation into the transatlantic joint business. In September 2020 and April 2022, the CMA adopted interim measures that effectively extend the EC commitments until March 2026 in light of the uncertainty and other impacts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The CMA restarted its investigation in September 2023 after a pause related to the COVID-19 pandemic and plans to complete the investigation before the scheduled expiration of the interim measures in March 2026. We continue to cooperate fully with the CMA. The foregoing arrangements are important aspects of our international network and we are dependent on the performance and continued cooperation of the other airlines party to those arrangements.On May 19, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts issued an order permanently enjoining American and JetBlue from continuing and further implementing the Northeast Alliance arrangement (NEA). In June 2023, JetBlue delivered a notice of termination of the NEA, effective July 29, 2023, and the carriers have substantially completed wind-down activities. American appealed the District Court’s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit; the First Circuit affirmed the District Court’s decision on November 8, 2024. Any petition for writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court would be due February 27, 2025. Separately, in December 2022, two putative class action lawsuits were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York alleging that American and JetBlue violated U.S. antitrust law in connection with the previously disclosed NEA. In February 2023, private party plaintiffs filed two additional putative class action antitrust complaints against American and JetBlue in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts and the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, respectively. All cases have since been consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. We believe these complaints are without merit and are defending against them vigorously.No assurances can be given as to any benefits that we may derive from any of the foregoing arrangements or any other arrangements that may ultimately be implemented, or whether regulators will, or if granted continue to, approve or impose material conditions on our business activities.Other mergers and other forms of airline partnerships, including regulatory approvals such as antitrust immunity grants, may take place and may not involve us as a participant, or could result in unforeseen impacts on the industry generally and our company in particular. Depending on which carriers combine or integrate and which assets, if any, are sold or otherwise transferred to other carriers in connection with any such transactions, our competitive position relative to the post-transaction carriers or other carriers that acquire such assets could be harmed. In addition, as carriers combine through traditional mergers or integrate their operations through other arrangements, their route networks will grow, and that growth will result in greater overlap with our network, which in turn could decrease our overall market share and revenues. Such combination or collaboration is not limited to the U.S., but could include further transactions among international carriers in Europe and elsewhere that result in broader networks offered by rival airlines.Additionally, our AAdvantage program, which is an important element of our business, faces significant and increasing competition from the loyalty programs offered by other travel companies, as well as from similar loyalty benefits offered by banks and other financial services companies. Competition among loyalty programs is intense regarding the rewards, fees, required usage, and other terms and conditions of these programs. In addition, we have used certain assets from our AAdvantage program as collateral for the AAdvantage Financing (defined in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to this Annual Report on Form 10-K), which contains covenants that impose restrictions on certain amendments or changes to certain of our AAdvantage program agreements provided as collateral under the AAdvantage Financing and other aspects of the AAdvantage program. These competitive factors and covenants (to the extent applicable) may affect our ability to attract and retain customers, increase usage of our loyalty program and maximize the revenue generated by our loyalty program. Further, we rely on partners to provide available space for mileage credit redemptions on their aircraft. Should partners not make available enough inventory within their cabins for 26Table of Contentsour members, the attractiveness of our program may be decreased, potentially impacting customer loyalty and program revenue.We may also be impacted by regulations affecting certain of our major commercial partners, including our co-branded credit card partners or our loyalty program. For example, there has been bipartisan legislation proposed in Congress called the Credit Card Competition Act designed to increase credit card transaction routing options for merchants which, if enacted, could result in a reduction of the fees levied on credit card transactions. If this legislation or any similar legislation or regulation were enacted, it could fundamentally alter the profitability of our agreements with co-branded credit card partners and the benefits we provide to our consumers through the co-branded credit cards issued by these partners. Additionally, the DOT recently launched an inquiry into certain airline loyalty programs, including AAdvantage, to investigate potential competition or consumer protection issues in airlines’ administration of these programs, and draft legislation introduced in Congress called the Protect Your Points Act similarly aims to regulate the management of these programs. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has recently cautioned companies against what it views as illegal or unlawful credit card practices, including purported devaluation of earned points, hidden conditions and failure to deliver on promised benefits. If regulatory or legislative efforts to impose restrictions on airline loyalty programs and regulations against credit card point devaluations were successful, they could materially reduce the revenues we derive from the AAdvantage program and adversely impact our results of operations.Union disputes, employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions may adversely affect our operations and financial performance.Relations between air carriers and labor unions in the U.S. are governed by the RLA. Under the RLA, CBAs generally contain “amendable dates” rather than expiration dates, and the RLA requires that a carrier maintain the existing terms and conditions of employment following the amendable date through a multi-stage and usually lengthy series of bargaining processes overseen by the NMB. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 87% of our employees were represented for collective bargaining purposes by labor unions, and 6% were covered by CBAs that are currently amendable or that will become amendable within one year. For the dates that the CBAs with our major work groups become amendable under the RLA, see “Labor Relations” under Item 1A. Risk Factors – “If we decide to make repurchases of or pay dividends on our common stock, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to do so or that such a capital deployment program will enhance long-term stockholder value.”55Table of ContentsOwnership RestrictionsAAG’s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws provide that, consistent with the requirements of Subtitle VII of Title 49 of the United States Code, as amended (the Aviation Act), any persons or entities who are not a “citizen of the United States” (as defined under the Aviation Act and administrative interpretations issued by the DOT, its predecessors and successors, from time to time), including any agent, trustee or representative of such persons or entities (a non-citizen), shall not, in the aggregate, own (beneficially or of record) and/or control more than (a) 24.9% of the aggregate votes of all of our outstanding equity securities or (b) 49.0% of our outstanding equity securities. Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws further specify that it is the duty of each stockholder who is a non-citizen to register his, her or its equity securities on our foreign stock record and provide for remedies applicable to stockholders that exceed the voting and ownership caps described above.In addition, to reduce the risk of a potential adverse effect on our ability to use our NOL carryforwards and certain other tax attributes for federal income tax purposes, and in connection with the expiration in December 2021 of certain transfer restrictions applicable to substantial shareholders contained in our Certificate of Incorporation, the Board of Directors of AAG adopted the Tax Benefit Preservation Plan. The Tax Benefit Preservation Plan was subsequently ratified by our stockholders at the 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of AAG. AAG entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Tax Benefit Preservation Plan to extend the expiration date to October 29, 2027, subject to approval by stockholders by October 29, 2025. The Tax Benefit Preservation Plan is designed to reduce the likelihood that we experience an ""ownership change” for purposes of Section 382 by deterring certain acquisitions of AAG common stock. There is no assurance, however, that the deterrent mechanism will be effective, and such acquisitions may still occur. In addition, the Tax Benefit Preservation Plan may adversely affect the marketability of AAG common stock by discouraging existing or potential investors from acquiring AAG common stock or additional shares of AAG common stock, because any non-exempt third party that acquires 4.9% or more of the then-outstanding shares of AAG common stock would suffer substantial dilution of its ownership interest in AAG.See Item 1A. Risk Factors – “AAG’s Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws and Tax Benefit Preservation Plan include provisions that limit voting and acquisition and disposition of our equity interests and specify an exclusive forum for certain stockholder disputes” and “Our ability to utilize our NOLs and other carryforwards may be limited.” Also see AAG’s Certification of Incorporation and Bylaws, which are filed as Exhibits 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 hereto, for the full text of the foregoing restrictions and AAG’s Description of the Registrants’ Securities Registered Pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which is filed as Exhibit 4.1 hereto, for a more detailed description.56Table of Contents",38268,rf,20250219,2025,10K,real_textdata_2025

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and other risks and uncertainties listed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC).All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this report. There may be other factors of which we are not currently aware that may affect matters discussed in the forward-looking statements and may also cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed. We do not assume any obligation to publicly update or supplement any forward-looking statement to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting such statements other than as required by law. Any forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or as of the dates indicated in the statements.5Table of ContentsSummary of Risk FactorsOur business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, or the trading price of our common stock or other securities. We caution the reader that these risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risks and uncertainties, nor can it assess the extent to which any of the risk factors below or any such new risks and uncertainties, or any combination thereof, may impact our business. These risks are more fully described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. These risks include, among others, the following:Risks Related to our Business and Industry •Downturns in economic conditions could adversely affect our business. •We will need to obtain sufficient financing or other capital to operate successfully.•Our high level of debt and other obligations may limit our ability to fund general corporate requirements and obtain additional financing, may limit our flexibility in responding to competitive developments and may cause our business to be vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions.•We have significant pension and other postretirement benefit funding obligations.•If our financial condition worsens, provisions in our credit card processing and other commercial agreements may adversely affect our liquidity.•The loss of key personnel who we depend on to operate our business, or the inability to attract, develop and retain additional qualified personnel could adversely affect our business.•Our business has been and will continue to be materially affected by many changing economic, geopolitical, commercial, regulatory and other conditions beyond our control, including global events that affect travel behavior.•The airline industry is intensely competitive and dynamic.•Union disputes, employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions may adversely affect our operations and financial performance.•If we encounter problems with any of our third-party regional operators or third-party service providers, our operations could be adversely affected by a resulting decline in revenue or negative public perception about our services.•Any damage to our reputation or brand image could adversely affect our business or financial results.•Risks of losses and adverse publicity from any public incidents involving our company, people or brand.•Changes to our business model that are designed to increase revenues and reduce costs may not be successful and may cause operational difficulties or decreased demand.•Our intellectual property rights, particularly our branding rights, are valuable, and any inability to protect them may adversely affect our business and financial results.•We may be a party to litigation in the normal course of business or otherwise, which could affect our financial position and liquidity.•Our ability to utilize our NOLs and other carryforwards may be limited, and any new U.S. and international tax legislation may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.6Table of Contents•We have a significant amount of goodwill, which is assessed for impairment at least annually. We may never realize the full value of our intangible or long-lived assets, causing us to record material impairment charges.•The commercial relationships that we have with other companies, including any related equity investments, may not produce the returns or results we expect.•Our business is very dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Continued periods of high volatility in fuel costs, increased fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a significant negative impact on consumer demand, our operating results and liquidity.•Our business is subject to extensive government regulation.•We operate a global business with international operations that are subject to economic and political instability and have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by numerous events, circumstances or government actions beyond our control.•We may be adversely affected by conflicts overseas, terrorist attacks or other acts of violence, domestically or abroad; the travel industry continues to face ongoing security concerns.•We are subject to risks associated with climate change, including increased regulation of our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, changing consumer preferences and the potential for increased impacts of severe weather events on our operations and infrastructure.•A shortage of pilots or other personnel could materially adversely affect our business.•We depend on a limited number of suppliers for aircraft, aircraft engines and parts. Delays in scheduled aircraft deliveries, unexpected grounding of aircraft or aircraft engines whether by regulators or by us, or other loss of anticipated fleet capacity, and failure of new aircraft to receive regulatory approval, be produced or otherwise perform as and when expected, adversely impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition.•We rely heavily on technology and automated systems, including artificial intelligence, to operate our business, and any failures could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.•Evolving data privacy requirements could increase our costs, and any significant data privacy incident could disrupt our operations, harm our reputation, expose us to legal risks and otherwise materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.•We are exposed to risks from cyberattacks, and any cybersecurity incidents involving us, our third-party service providers, or one of our AAdvantage partners or other business partners.•We rely on third-party distribution channels and must effectively manage the costs, rights and functionality of these channels.•If we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate facilities and infrastructure throughout our system and, at some airports, adequate slots, we may be unable to operate our existing flight schedule and to expand or change our route network in the future.•Interruptions or disruptions in service at one of our key facilities.•Increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage, and heavy taxation of the airline industry.7Table of Contents Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – “2024 Financial Overview,” “AAG’s Results of Operations” and “American’s Results of Operations” for further discussion of AAG’s and American’s operating results and operating performance. Also, see Note 1(m) to each of AAG’s and American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Items 8A and 8B, respectively, for passenger revenue by geographic region and Note 13 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 12 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for segment disclosures. RegionalOur regional carriers provide scheduled air transportation under the brand name “American Eagle.” The American Eagle carriers include our wholly-owned regional carriers Envoy Air Inc. (Envoy), PSA and Piedmont, as well as third-party regional carriers including Republic Airways Inc. (Republic), SkyWest Airlines, Inc. (SkyWest) and Air Wisconsin Airlines LLC (Air Wisconsin). Our regional carriers are an integral component of our operating network. We rely heavily on regional carriers to serve small markets and also to drive connecting traffic to our hubs from markets that are not economical for us to serve with larger, mainline aircraft. In addition, regional carriers offer complementary service in many of our mainline markets. All American Eagle carriers use logos, service marks, aircraft paint schemes and uniforms similar to those of our mainline operations. In 2024, 54 million passengers boarded our regional flights, approximately 45% of whom connected to or from our mainline flights. In January 2025, we announced a wind-down of our relationship with Air Wisconsin, which we expect to conclude in the second quarter of 2025.8Table of ContentsOur regional carrier arrangements are principally in the form of capacity purchase agreements with our third-party regional partners and similar arrangements with our wholly-owned affiliates which provide that all revenues, including passenger, in-flight, ancillary, mail and freight revenues, go to us. We control marketing, scheduling, ticketing, pricing and seat inventories. In return, we agree to pay predetermined fees to these airlines for operating an agreed-upon number of aircraft, without regard to the number of passengers on board. In addition, these agreements provide that we either reimburse or pay 100% of certain variable costs, such as airport landing fees, fuel and passenger liability insurance.CargoOur cargo division provides a wide range of freight and mail services, with facilities and interline connections available across the globe. In 2024, we served approximately 21,000 unique origin and destination pairs, transporting over 1.0 billion pounds of time-sensitive freight and mail across our network. We continue to focus on enhancements that enable us to better serve our customers, including expanding our digital offerings, which provide greater efficiency, increased accuracy, 24/7 access to search schedules, and the ability to check availability, retrieve rates and make bookings.Distribution and Marketing AgreementsPassengers can purchase tickets for travel on American through several distribution channels, including our website (www.aa.com), our mobile app and our reservations centers, and through third-party distribution channels, including conventional travel agents, travel management companies and online travel agents (e.g., Expedia, including its booking sites Orbitz and Travelocity, and Booking Holdings, including its booking sites Kayak and Priceline). Over the last decade, American has been a leader in deploying new distribution technologies such as IATA New Distribution Capability (NDC) technology, which is now the primary means by which we distribute our content to third parties through aggregators (e.g., Amadeus, Sabre, Travelport and Travelfusion) or through direct connections. NDC technology provides customers access to enhanced content and functionality, providing a simplified booking experience, and enabling us to provide more relevant, tailored offers to customers.To remain competitive, we will need to successfully manage our distribution costs and rights, increase our distribution flexibility and improve the functionality of our distribution channels, while maintaining an industry-competitive cost structure. For more discussion, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – “We rely on third-party distribution channels and must effectively manage the costs, rights and functionality of these channels.”Member of oneworld AllianceAmerican is a founding member of the oneworld Alliance, which currently includes Alaska Airlines, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Finnair, Iberia, Japan Airlines, Malaysia Airlines, Qantas Airways (Qantas), Qatar Airways, Royal Air Maroc, Royal Jordanian Airlines and SriLankan Airlines. Oman Air is expected to join the oneworld Alliance in 2025. Fiji Airways is currently a oneworld connect partner offering select alliance benefits to oneworld frequent flyers and is expected to become a full member of the oneworld Alliance in 2025. The oneworld Alliance links the networks of member carriers and their respective affiliates to enhance customer service and provide smooth connections to the destinations served by the alliance, including linking member carriers’ loyalty programs and providing reciprocal access to the carriers’ airport lounge facilities.Joint Business Agreements and Other Cooperation AgreementsAmerican has established a transatlantic joint business with British Airways, Aer Lingus, Iberia and Finnair, a transpacific joint business with Japan Airlines and a joint business covering Australia and New Zealand with Qantas. Joint business agreements enable the carriers involved to cooperate on flights between particular destinations and allow pooling and sharing of certain revenues and costs, enhanced loyalty program reciprocity and cooperation in other areas. Joint business agreements have become a common approach among major carriers to address key regulatory restrictions typically applicable to international airline service, including limitations on the foreign ownership of airlines and national laws prohibiting foreign airlines from carrying passengers beyond specific gateway cities.We also have established a strategic alliance with Alaska Airlines and a strategic alliance with Qatar Airways in order to provide customers with improved schedules and network connection opportunities, enhanced loyalty program reciprocity and cooperation in other areas.9Table of ContentsIn July 2010, in connection with a regulatory review related to our transatlantic joint business, we provided certain commitments to the European Commission (EC) regarding, among other things, the availability of take-off and landing slots at London Heathrow (LHR) or London Gatwick (LGW) airports. The commitments accepted by the EC were binding for 10 years. In anticipation of both the exit of the United Kingdom (UK) from the European Union (EU), commonly referred to as Brexit, and the expiry of the EC commitments in July 2020, the United Kingdom Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), in October 2018, opened an investigation into the transatlantic joint business. In September 2020 and April 2022, the CMA adopted interim measures that effectively extend the EC commitments until March 2026 in light of the uncertainty and other impacts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The CMA restarted its investigation in September 2023 after a pause related to the COVID-19 pandemic and plans to complete the investigation before the scheduled expiration of the interim measures in March 2026. We continue to cooperate fully with the CMA.Marketing RelationshipsTo improve access to each other’s markets, various U.S. and foreign air carriers, including American, have established marketing agreements with other airlines. These marketing agreements vary in scope and are intended to provide enhanced customer choice by means of an expanded network with reciprocal loyalty program participation, but do not involve the same level of cooperation as our joint businesses or strategic alliances. As of December 31, 2024, in addition to the relationships described above, American had codeshare, marketing and/or loyalty program relationships with Air Tahiti Nui, Cathay Pacific, China Southern Airlines Company Limited (China Southern Airlines), Etihad Airways, Fiji Airways, GOL Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes S.A. (GOL), Gulf Air, Hawaiian Airlines, IndiGo, JetSMART, Jetstar, Jetstar Japan, Korean Air Lines, Malaysia Airlines, Philippine Airlines, Royal Air Maroc, Royal Jordanian Airlines, SriLankan Airlines and Vueling Airlines.AAdvantage® ProgramOur AAdvantage program was established to develop passenger loyalty by offering benefits and rewards to travelers for their continued patronage with American and our partners. AAdvantage members enjoy exclusive benefits and earn AAdvantage mileage credits (miles) for flying on eligible tickets on American, any oneworld Alliance airline or other partner airlines. For every dollar spent by flying on an eligible American ticket, members earn mileage credits, and AAdvantage Gold®, AAdvantage Platinum®, AAdvantage Platinum Pro® and AAdvantage Executive Platinum® status holders earn additional bonus mileage credits of 40%, 60%, 80% and 120%, respectively. Members also earn mileage credits by using the services of more than 1,000 non-flight partners, such as our co-branded credit cards, certain hotel and car rental companies and shopping and dining partners. The AAdvantage program in general, and our co-branded credit card programs in particular, are material assets of our business and have become increasingly important to our company over time. In December 2024, we announced a 10-year agreement with Citibank N.A. (Citi) to become the exclusive issuer of the AAdvantage co-branded credit card portfolio in the U.S. starting in 2026. During 2024 and 2023, cash payments from co-branded credit card and other partners were $6.1 billion and $5.2 billion, respectively, an increase of 17% year-over-year. Cash remuneration in 2024 included a one-time cash payment related to the new co-branded credit card agreement announced in December 2024.Mileage credits can be redeemed for travel and upgraded experiences on American and participating airlines, access to our Admirals Club® and Flagship Lounges®, or for other non-flight awards, such as car rentals and hotels, from our program partners. Travel awards are available on all flights operated by American and, subject to capacity-controlled seating, on flights operated by our partners. A member’s mileage credits generally do not expire if that member has any type of qualifying activity at least once every 24 months or if the AAdvantage member is the primary holder of a co-branded credit card. AAdvantage members qualify for status over a 12-month period beginning on March 1 of each year by earning Loyalty Points, which can be earned through a variety of qualifying travel and non-travel activities, including use of our co-branded credit cards. Status members can enjoy additional travel benefits of the AAdvantage program, including complimentary upgrades, checked bags, and Preferred and Main Cabin Extra seats, as well as priority check-in, security, boarding and baggage delivery when traveling on American, any oneworld Alliance airline or select partner airlines. In addition, AAdvantage members can unlock benefits, rewards and choices before, between and beyond the traditional status tiers with Loyalty Point Rewards. AAdvantage Business, our business loyalty program, rewards both eligible companies with AAdvantage miles and their travelers with additional Loyalty Points when booking business travel. In 2024, the digital news outlet, The Points Guy, selected AAdvantage as the Best U.S. Airline Loyalty Program for the second consecutive year based on the ease of earning miles, the value of mileage redemptions and benefits offered by the program.10Table of ContentsUnder our agreements with AAdvantage members and program partners, we reserve the right to change the terms of the AAdvantage program at any time and without notice. Program rules, partners, special offers, awards and requisite mileage levels for awards are subject to change.During 2024, our members redeemed approximately 15 million awards, including travel redemptions for flights and upgrades on American and other air carriers, as well as redemption of car and hotel awards, club memberships and merchandise, among others. Approximately 9% of our 2024 total revenue passenger miles flown were from award travel.See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” for more information on our loyalty program.Industry CompetitionDomesticThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive. On most of our domestic nonstop routes, we face competing service from other domestic airlines, including major network airlines, low-cost carriers and ultra-low-cost carriers such as Alaska Airlines, Allegiant Air, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, JetBlue, Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines and United Airlines. Between cities that require a connection, where the major airlines compete via their respective hubs, competition is significant. In addition, we face competition on some of our connecting routes from airlines operating point-to-point service on such routes. We also compete with all-cargo and charter airlines and, particularly on shorter segments, ground and rail transportation.In general, beyond nonstop city pairs, carriers that have the greatest ability to seamlessly connect passengers to and from markets have a competitive advantage. In some cases, however, foreign governments limit U.S. air carriers’ rights to transport passengers beyond designated gateway cities in foreign countries. In order to improve access to domestic and foreign markets, we have arrangements with other airlines including through the oneworld Alliance, other cooperation agreements, joint business agreements and marketing relationships, as further discussed herein.On all of our routes, pricing decisions are affected, in large part, by the need to meet competition from other airlines. Price competition occurs on a market-by-market basis through price discounts, changes in pricing structures, fare matching, targeted promotions and loyalty program initiatives. Airlines typically use discounted fares and other promotions to stimulate traffic during normally weak travel periods, when they begin service to new cities, when they have excess capacity, to generate cash flow, to maximize revenue per available seat mile or to establish, increase or preserve market share. Most airlines will quickly match price reductions in a particular market, and we have often elected to match discounted or promotional fares initiated by other air carriers in certain markets in order to compete in those markets. In addition, we face pricing pressures from so-called ultra-low-cost carriers, such as Allegiant Air, Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines, which compete in many of the markets in which we operate.In addition to price competition, airlines compete for market share by increasing the size of their route system and the number of markets they serve. The American Eagle regional carriers increase the number of markets we serve by flying to smaller markets and providing connections at our hubs. Many of our competitors also own or have agreements with regional airlines that provide similar services at their hubs and other locations. We also compete on the basis of scheduling (frequency and flight times), availability of nonstop flights, on-time performance, type of equipment, cabin configuration, amenities provided to passengers, loyalty programs, the automation of travel agent reservation systems, onboard products, health and safety, sustainability initiatives and other services.InternationalIn addition to our extensive domestic service, we provide international service to Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, Central and South America, Europe, Qatar, China, Japan, South Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand. In providing international air transportation, we compete with other U.S. airlines, foreign investor-owned airlines and foreign state-owned or state-affiliated airlines. Competition has also been increasing from low-cost airlines executing international long-haul expansion strategies, a trend we expect to continue, in particular with the planned introduction of long-range narrowbody aircraft in the coming years.In order to increase our ability to compete in the market for international air transportation service, which is subject to extensive government regulation, U.S. and foreign carriers have entered into bilateral and multilateral marketing relationships, alliances, cooperation agreements and joint business agreements to exchange traffic among each other’s flights and route networks. See “Distribution and Marketing Agreements” above for further discussion.11Table of ContentsSustainabilityOperating a sustainable business that has the ability to serve our stakeholders over the long-term is an important part of our strategy. We have increased our focus over time on a number of elements that we view as important to build a more sustainable company, including those described below.We have received recognition for our progress toward our sustainability goals. In 2024, we returned to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the second consecutive year and to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index for the fourth consecutive year.ClimateWe recognize the challenge of climate change and have set ambitious goals to transition to operating a low-carbon airline over time. Our aim is to achieve net zero GHG emissions by 2050, and we have set an intermediate target to drive progress toward that goal. We have received validation from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) that our 2035 GHG reduction target complies with the criteria in the SBTi’s first aviation pathway.The vast majority of our direct GHG emissions come from the use of jet fuel in our operations. Our current strategy for reaching net zero GHG emissions by 2050 is focused on running a more fuel-efficient operation, with more fuel-efficient aircraft, powered by low-carbon fuel. To do so, we are working to drive progress across several key levers, including:•Continuing to replace older, less fuel-efficient aircraft with new, more efficient aircraft over time;•Helping scale the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) with the aim of transitioning to lower-carbon fuels. Currently, SAF is not available at the cost or scale necessary to meet our industry’s needs. We continue to enter into agreements to purchase SAF as part of our goal to replace 10% of our conventional jet fuel with SAF in 2030 and to encourage investment in SAF; and•Evaluating and investing in innovations that may enable commercial aircraft to be powered by low- and no-carbon fuel sources over the long term. For example, we have made direct investments in companies working to develop hydrogen-electric propulsion technology and green hydrogen distribution. We are also an anchor partner of Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, which aims to make investments to accelerate the development of new clean energy technologies, including SAF.Achieving our ambitious goals will require significant action and investments by governments, manufacturers and other stakeholders. We are committed to engaging with our stakeholders to seek to advance these initiatives and have dedicated resources to advance our own progress. Our Board of Directors and Corporate Governance and Public Responsibility Committee receive updates on our climate strategy, progress and key risks regularly. Our Chief Executive Officer is responsible for oversight of our climate change strategy.SafetyThe safety of our customers and team members is a top priority. Our approach to safety is guided by our Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-approved safety management systems (SMS), an organization-wide approach to identifying and managing risk. Each SMS is comprised of four components: Safety Policy, Safety Assurance, Safety Risk Management and Safety Promotion. Our Safety Policy sets safety objectives while striving to comply with applicable regulatory requirements and laws in the countries where we operate and establishing standards for acceptable operational behaviors.The Safety Assurance component of our SMS specifies how we use data and conduct quality assurance and internal oversight to validate the effectiveness of risk controls and the performance of the SMS. The Safety Risk Management (SRM) element of our SMS provides a decision-making process for identifying hazards and mitigating risk based on a thorough understanding of our systems and their operating environment. We employ SRM whenever there is a significant change to our operations, such as the delivery of new aircraft. Lastly, the Safety Promotion component includes training and raising awareness among team members so that they can spot potential safety events.CustomersWe fly to over 350 destinations in the United States and internationally, and we are committed to providing our customers with a world-class travel experience. We continued to rigorously measure and track customer satisfaction through passenger surveys in 2024, efforts that led to further improvements in our operations and the services we provide. 12Table of ContentsIn 2024, we were recognized for the seventh consecutive year with the prestigious Five Star rating in The APEX Official Airline Ratings – Global Airline category. This rating is based on verified customer feedback on the overall travel experience.Our PeopleThe airline business is labor intensive, and our team members are critical to delivering for our customers. The operational complexity of our business requires a diverse team of personnel trained and experienced in a variety of technical areas such as flight operations, ground operations, safety and maintenance, customer service and airline scheduling and planning. Fostering a culture where our team members feel supported to take care of our customers is critical to our success. To do this, we must continue to hire the best and the brightest, ensure that people from all backgrounds are aware of the opportunities that exist in aviation, and create a culture where everyone can reach their full potential and thrive.In 2024, mainline and regional salaries, wages and benefits were our largest expense and represented 36% of our total operating expenses. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 133,300 active full-time equivalent employees, approximately 87% of whom were represented by various labor unions responsible for negotiating the collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) governing their compensation and job duties, among other things. Talent DevelopmentWe focus on providing our team members with the tools, training and resources they need to do their best work. We maintain a suite of programs aimed at helping our people develop the skills and experience they need to succeed in their roles and build rewarding, long-term careers within our company. Additionally, we have partnered with leading online learning platforms to make professional development available on-demand to all of our team members.Our CultureWe seek to hire the best and brightest and to create a workplace where all perspectives and experiences are welcomed, valued and encouraged and where every individual, regardless of their national origin, religion, race, gender, sexual orientation or background, not only knows they belong, but that they can thrive at our company. Our goal is to make culture a competitive advantage so people will want to work with us, fly with us and invest in us. We believe in:•Hiring, engaging and retaining the best and the brightest talent for growth;•Delivering excellence in our operations to serve and expand our global markets;•Striving to have our teams build connections and trust with all who fly with us; and•Driving industry innovation to build competitive advantages.In 2024, we received a perfect score on the Disability Equality Index for the ninth consecutive year and were named one of the best places to work for disability inclusion.Competitive Pay and Comprehensive BenefitsWe seek to offer competitive pay, comprehensive benefits and a wide variety of resources designed to support the physical, behavioral and financial well-being of our team members and their families, including medical coverage that is intended to be affordable and flexible along with healthcare navigation and support tools.Our internal recognition programs give team members and customers the opportunity to show their appreciation for a job well done, including through our Nonstop Thanks program whereby team members can award each other points for exceptional service or as an expression of gratitude. Recognition points earned through the recognition program can be redeemed for items in an online catalog. In 2024, our team members were recognized by customers, peers and company leaders approximately three million times and more than 1,300 peer nominations were submitted for the annual Circle of Excellence, the highest honor that we bestow upon our team members for their career achievements.13Table of ContentsOur future success depends in large part on our ability to attract, develop and retain highly qualified management, technical and other personnel. We may not be successful in attracting, developing or retaining key personnel or other highly qualified personnel. In addition, competition for skilled personnel has intensified and may continue to intensify if overall industry capacity continues to increase and/or we were to incur attrition at levels higher than we have historically. For more discussion, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – “The loss of key personnel who we depend on to operate our business, or the inability to attract, develop and retain additional qualified personnel could adversely affect our business.”Labor RelationsLabor relations in the air transportation industry are regulated under the Railway Labor Act (RLA), which vests in the National Mediation Board (NMB) certain functions with respect to disputes between airlines and labor unions relating to union representation and CBAs.The following table shows our domestic airline employee groups that are represented by unions:UnionClass or CraftEmployees (1)ContractAmendable DateMainline: Allied Pilots Association (APA)Pilots14,350 2027Association of Professional Flight Attendants (APFA)Flight Attendants25,520 2029Airline Customer Service Employee Association – Communications Workers of America and International Brotherhood of Teamsters (CWA-IBT) Passenger Service13,680 2029Transport Workers Union and International Association of Machinists & Aerospace Workers (TWU-IAM Association) Mechanics and Related12,980 2027TWU-IAM AssociationFleet Service19,520 2027TWU-IAM AssociationStock Clerks2,060 2027TWU-IAM AssociationFlight Simulator Engineers150 2025TWU-IAM AssociationMaintenance Control Technicians190 2027TWU-IAM AssociationMaintenance Training Instructors100 2027Professional Airline Flight Control Association (PAFCA)Dispatchers550 2025Transport Workers Union (TWU)Flight Crew Training Instructors370 2025Envoy: Air Line Pilots Associations (ALPA)Pilots2,120 2029Association of Flight Attendants-CWA (AFA)Flight Attendants2,020 2026TWUGround School Instructors10 2027TWUMechanics and Related1,290 2027TWUStock Clerks130 2027TWUSimulator Instructors20 2026TWUFleet Service4,170 2026TWUDispatchers80 2025Communications Workers of America (CWA)Passenger Service7,340 2026Piedmont: ALPAPilots730 2029AFAFlight Attendants360 2026International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT)Mechanics and Related520 2026IBTStock Clerks60 2026CWAFleet and Passenger Service7,010 2023IBTDispatchers40 2025ALPAFlight Crew Training Instructors60 202914Table of ContentsUnionClass or CraftEmployees (1)ContractAmendable DatePSA: ALPAPilots1,710 2028AFAFlight Attendants1,370 2023International Association of Machinists & Aerospace Workers (IAM)Mechanics and Related710 2027TWUDispatchers50 2024ALPAFlight Crew Training Instructors60 2028(1)Represents approximate number of active employees as of December 31, 2024.In 2024, new five-year CBAs were ratified by the APFA and CWA-IBT, the unions representing our mainline flight attendants and passenger service team members, respectively. Also in 2024, the TWU-IAM ratified a two-year contract extension for our mainline maintenance and fleet service team members. Among our wholly-owned regional subsidiaries, Piedmont fleet and passenger service and PSA flight attendants and dispatchers have agreements that are now amendable and we are engaged in negotiations.For more discussion, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – “Union disputes, employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions may adversely affect our operations and financial performance.”Aircraft FuelOur operations and financial results are materially affected by the availability and price of aircraft fuel, which represents one of the largest single cost items in our business. Based on our 2025 forecasted mainline and regional fuel consumption, we estimate that a one cent per gallon increase in the price of aircraft fuel would increase our 2025 annual fuel expense by approximately $45 million.The following table shows annual aircraft fuel consumption and costs, including taxes, for our mainline and regional operations for 2024 and 2023 (gallons and aircraft fuel expense in millions).YearGallonsAverage Priceper GallonAircraft FuelExpensePercent of TotalOperating Expenses20244,391$2.60$11,41822%20234,140$2.96$12,25725%As of December 31, 2024, we did not have any fuel hedging contracts outstanding to hedge our fuel consumption. Our current policy is not to enter into transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, although we review this policy from time to time based on market conditions and other factors. As such, and assuming we do not enter into any future transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, we will continue to be fully exposed to fluctuations in aircraft fuel prices.Aircraft fuel prices have in the past, and may in the future, experience substantial volatility. We cannot predict the future availability, price volatility or cost of aircraft fuel. For more discussion, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – “Our business is very dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Continued periods of high volatility in fuel costs, increased fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a significant negative impact on consumer demand, our operating results and liquidity.”Seasonality and Other FactorsDue to the greater demand for air travel during the summer months, revenues in the airline industry exhibit seasonal patterns based on the peak travel periods. General economic conditions, fears of terrorism or war, fare initiatives, fluctuations in fuel prices, labor actions, weather, natural disasters, outbreaks of disease, geopolitical factors and other factors could impact this seasonal pattern. Therefore, our quarterly results of operations are not necessarily indicative of operating results for the entire year, and historical operating results in a quarterly or annual period are not necessarily indicative of future operating results.15Table of ContentsDomestic and Global Regulatory LandscapeGeneralAirlines are subject to extensive domestic and international regulatory requirements. Domestically, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and the FAA exercise significant regulatory authority over air carriers.The DOT, among other things, oversees and regulates domestic and international codeshare agreements, international route authorities, competition and consumer protection matters including accessibility, the display and sharing of ancillary fee information and refund practices. The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, along with the DOT in certain instances, have jurisdiction over airline antitrust matters.The FAA similarly exercises safety oversight and regulates most operational matters of our business, including how we operate and maintain our aircraft. FAA requirements cover, among other things, required technology and necessary onboard equipment; systems, procedures and training necessary to ensure the continuous airworthiness of our fleet of aircraft; safety measures and equipment; crew scheduling limitations and experience requirements; and many other technical aspects of airline operations. Additionally, our pilots and other employees are subject to rigorous certification standards, and our pilots and other crew members must adhere to flight time and rest requirements.The FAA also controls the national airspace system, including operational rules and fees for air traffic control (ATC) services. The efficiency, reliability and capacity of the ATC network has a significant impact on our costs and on the timeliness of our operations.The U.S. Postal Service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related services.Airport Access and OperationsDomestically, any U.S. airline authorized by the DOT is generally free to operate scheduled passenger service between any two points within the U.S. and its territories, with the exception of certain airports that require landing and take-off rights and authorizations (slots) and other facilities, and certain airports that impose geographic limitations on operations or curtail operations based on the time of day. Operations at three major domestic airports we serve (John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) and LaGuardia Airport (LGA) in New York City, and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) near Washington, D.C.) and many foreign airports we serve (including LHR) are regulated by governmental entities through allocations of slots or similar regulatory mechanisms that limit the rights of carriers to conduct operations at those airports. Each slot represents the authorization to land at and take off from the particular airport during a specified time period. In addition to slot restrictions, operations at DCA and LGA are also limited based on a so-called “perimeter rule” which generally limits the stage length of the flights that can be operated from those airports to 1,250 and 1,500 miles, respectively. Generally, our ability to retain slots is conditioned on the continued use of such slots, and in the absence of use, the slots are subject to forfeiture. In certain circumstances, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic, regulators may issue slot waivers which temporarily suspend or amend slot usage requirements, and we have used slot waivers at times to reduce flying levels during periods of reduced demand for travel. Moreover, on occasions in 2023 and 2024, the FAA issued slot waivers for New York City area airports as a result of operational challenges arising from ATC staffing shortages; those waivers are now set to expire in October 2025, and we cannot guarantee that such waivers will be made available to us, or that upon expiration or cancellation of such waivers it will be economical for us to resume prior levels of flying to destinations where we have operated a reduced service. If we are forced to surrender slots or other rights, we may be unable to provide our desired level of service to or from certain destinations in the future. For more discussion, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – “If we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate facilities and infrastructure throughout our system and, at some airports, adequate slots, we may be unable to operate our existing flight schedule and to expand or change our route network in the future, which may have a material adverse impact on our operations.”Our ability to provide service can also be impaired at airports where the airport gates and other facilities are currently inadequate to accommodate all of the service that we would like to provide, or where we have no access to gates at all.Existing law also permits domestic local airport authorities to implement procedures and impose restrictions designed to abate noise, provided such procedures and restrictions do not unreasonably interfere with interstate or foreign commerce or the national transportation system. In some instances, these restrictions have caused curtailments in service or increases in operating costs.16Table of ContentsAirline Fares, Taxes and User FeesAirlines are permitted to establish their own domestic fares without governmental regulation. The DOT maintains authority over certain international fares, rates and charges, but only applies this authority on a limited basis. In addition, international fares, rates and charges are sometimes subject to the jurisdiction of the governments of the foreign countries which we serve.Airlines are obligated to collect a federal excise tax, commonly referred to as the “ticket tax,” on domestic and international air transportation, and to collect other taxes and charge other fees, such as foreign taxes, security fees and passenger facility charges. Although these taxes and fees are not our operating expenses, they represent an additional cost to our customers. These taxes and fees are subject to increase from time to time.DOT Passenger Protection RulesThe DOT regulates airline interactions with passengers through the ticketing process, at the airport and onboard the aircraft. Among other things, these regulations govern how our fares are displayed online, required customer disclosures, access by disabled passengers, handling of long onboard flight delays and reporting of mishandled bags. In April 2024, the DOT issued a final rule mandating refunds in certain circumstances (refund rule), and a final rule requiring disclosure of certain ancillary fees by air carriers and travel agents (ancillary fee rule). We met the compliance deadline of October 28, 2024 for the refund rule. In July 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit granted the airline associations and individual airlines’ motion for a stay of the ancillary fee rule. In August 2024, the DOT issued a proposed rulemaking related to family seating, which would require airlines to seat children aged 13 and under adjacent to at least one accompanying adult at no additional cost beyond the fare, subject to limited exceptions. In December 2024, the DOT published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking titled “Airline Passenger Rights.” Specifically, the DOT is soliciting comments on requiring airlines to pay passengers cash compensation, to provide free rebooking, to cover meals and to provide overnight lodging and related transportation expenses when a disruption is airline-caused. The DOT is also soliciting comments on requiring airlines to provide free rebooking, to cover meals and to provide lodging and related transportation expenses for significant domestic flight disruptions, regardless of the cause of the disruption. Also in December 2024, the DOT published a final rule on “Ensuring Safe Accommodations for Air Travelers with Disabilities Using Wheelchairs” which sets new standards for assistance, mandates hands-on training for airline employees and contractors who physically assist passengers with disabilities and handle passengers’ wheelchairs, and specifies actions that airlines must take to protect passengers when a wheelchair is damaged or delayed during transport. Individual requirements in the final rule have varying implementation timelines, ranging from January 16, 2025 (the effective date of the final rule) to June 17, 2026.InternationalInternational air transportation is subject to extensive government regulation, including aviation agreements between the U.S. and other countries or governmental authorities, such as the EU. Moreover, our alliances with international carriers may be subject to the jurisdiction and regulations of various foreign agencies. The U.S. government has negotiated “open skies” agreements with more than 130 trading partners, which allow unrestricted route authority access between the U.S. and the foreign markets.In addition, foreign countries impose passenger protection rules, which are analogous to, and often meet or exceed the requirements of, the DOT passenger protection rules discussed above. In cases where these foreign requirements exceed the DOT rules, we may bear additional burdens and liabilities. Further, various foreign airport authorities impose slot, noise and curfew restrictions at their local airports.17Table of ContentsSecurityAll aspects of civil aviation and border security in the U.S. affecting U.S. carriers are controlled or regulated by the federal government through the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). The TSA is responsible for the security of the nation’s transportation systems. The TSA’s requirements for aviation security include, among other things, screening of passengers, baggage, cargo, mail, employees and vendors; carriage of federal air marshals at no charge; and continuous background checks of all employees and vendor employees with access to secure areas of airports. Funding for the TSA is provided by a combination of air carrier fees, passenger fees and taxpayer funds. The CBP is responsible for securing the nation’s borders by combining customs, immigration and agricultural protection. The CBP regulatory requirements include the advanced transmission of reservation records, passport and cargo data to facilitate lawful travel and trade into the U.S. Funding for a portion of CBP operations is provided by a combination of fees collected by airlines. Our international service further requires us to comply with host government civil aviation security regimes and foreign border control authorities.Environmental MattersEnvironmental RegulationThe airline industry is subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries. U.S. federal laws with a particular effect on our operations include the A",49994,mgmt,20250219,2025,10K,real_textdata_2025

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation"" of this Form 10-K, as well as in our consolidated financial statements, related notes, and the other information appearing in this Form 10-K and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC""). We do not intend, and undertake no obligation except as required by law, to update any of our forward-looking statements after the date of this Form 10-K to reflect actual results or future events or circumstances. Given these risks and uncertainties, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.Risk Factor SummaryOur businesses are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Any of the following risk factors may cause our actual results to differ materially from historical or anticipated results. These risks and uncertainties are not all inclusive, but represent the risks that we currently believe are material. There may be additional risks that we do not currently consider to be material or of which we are not currently aware. Any of these risks, as well as the risks described below, could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical or anticipated results and could materially and adversely affect several aspects of our performance.Risks Related to our Regulatory Environment, Industry and Businesses•Our businesses are subject to extensive laws and regulations, including laws and regulations unique to the industries in which our businesses operate, that may subject them to government investigations and significant monetary penalties and compliance-related burdens.•The transactions we offer to consumers may be negatively characterized by government officials, consumer advocacy groups and the media.•Adverse macroeconomic conditions, such as inflation, a higher cost of living and elevated interest rates for extended periods, as well as other factors outside of our control, may adversely affect demand for our products and services and/or our customers' ability to make the payments they owe for such products and services.•In an uncertain macroeconomic environment, our proprietary algorithms and decisioning tools used in approving our customers may no longer be indicative of their ability to perform.•A large percentage of Progressive Leasing's revenue, which represents approximately 96% of PROG Holdings' consolidated revenue, is concentrated with several key point-of-sale partners (whom we refer to as our ""POS partners"").•Progressive Leasing serves subprime consumers, and its lease-to-own business model poses inherent risks that may have an adverse impact on our financial performance. •Although Vive and Four also serve subprime and near-prime consumers, their business models differ significantly from Progressive Leasing's lease-to-own business, which means each of these businesses have different risk profiles.•Our efforts to modernize and enhance certain enterprise-wide information management systems and technologies could adversely impact our business and operations.•Any significant disruptions in our information technology systems or the systems of our key vendors, whether from cyber-attacks, software errors, bugs, defects or otherwise, may prevent us from processing transactions timely and accurately (including making accurate lease and loan decisioning).•Our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be sufficient to prevent losses in the event we experience a significant disruption in our information technology systems.•Our inability to protect confidential, proprietary, or sensitive information, including the confidential information of our customers, may be adversely affected by cyber-attacks or similar disruptions which may result in significant costs, litigation and reputational damage or otherwise have a material adverse impact on several aspects of our performance.3•Our capital allocation strategy and financial policies, including our current stock repurchase and dividend programs, as well as any potential debt repurchase program, may not be effective at enhancing shareholder value, or providing other benefits we expect.•From time to time, we may undertake significant cost reduction initiatives, which may not be adequate or may have unintended consequences that could be disruptive to our businesses.•The loss of services of our key executives or our inability to attract and retain key talent, particularly with respect to our information technology function, may have a material adverse impact on our operations.Risks Related to Our Indebtedness•We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.•The terms of our indebtedness may restrict our current and future business plans and strategies, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions.•The portion of our indebtedness that is variable in nature subjects us to interest rate risk, which may cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.General Risk Factors•Our stock price is volatile, and you may not be able to recover your investment if our stock price declines.•If we fail to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, or report them in a timely manner.•If securities or industry analysts publish research that is unfavorable about our business, our stock price and trading volume may decline.•Our actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance.4 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSOur businesses are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition, or the trading price of our common stock, some of which are described below. These risk factors may not be all of the risks our businesses face because we operate in a continually changing regulatory and macroeconomic environment, and new risks and uncertainties may emerge from time to time. We cannot predict such new risks and uncertainties, nor can we assess the extent to which any of the risk factors below or any such new risks and uncertainties, or any combination thereof, may impact our businesses.Risk FactorsRisks Related to our Regulatory Environment, Industry and BusinessesOur businesses are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, including certain laws and regulations unique to the industries in which our businesses operate, that may subject them to government investigations and significant monetary penalties, remediation expenses and compliance-related burdens that may result in them changing the manner in which they operate, which may be materially adverse to several aspects of our performance.In recent years, federal regulatory authorities have increasingly focused on alternative consumer financial services products, including consumer protection within the subprime financial marketplace in which our businesses operate. For example, in April 2020, our Progressive Leasing business entered into a settlement with the FTC (the ""FTC Settlement"") to resolve allegations by the FTC that certain of Progressive Leasing's advertising and marketing practices violated the FTC Act, even though Progressive Leasing believed it was in compliance with the FTC Act, and thus, did not admit any violations of that act or any other laws. Under the FTC Settlement, Progressive Leasing paid $175 million to the FTC and agreed to enhance certain of its compliance-related activities, including augmenting disclosures to its customers and expanding its POS partner monitoring programs. If federal regulatory authorities continue to focus on alternative consumer financial services products, including within the industries in which our businesses operate, this may result in increased compliance costs and the possibility of significant monetary penalties, remediation expenses and costly changes to the manner in which we conduct our businesses.State regulatory authorities have also been focused on the subprime financial marketplace, including the lease-to-own industry. For example, in August 2022, a complaint was filed by the Pennsylvania Attorney General against the Company's Progressive Leasing business alleging, among other things, that Progressive Leasing had violated the Pennsylvania Rental Purchase Agreement Act by failing to disclose certain terms and conditions of rent-to-own (""RTO"") transactions on ""hang tags"" physically attached to RTO merchandise. Although the Company believed the Pennsylvania Attorney General's claims were without merit, it entered into a settlement with the Pennsylvania Attorney General in January 2024, pursuant to which the Attorney General agreed to release its claims against Progressive Leasing. That settlement was approved by the court where the lawsuit was pending on January 26, 2024. Although no other states have alleged such claims against Progressive Leasing, we expect that certain state regulatory authorities will continue their increased focus on alternative consumer financial services products, and, as a result, businesses transacting with subprime consumers, for example, may be held to higher standards of monitoring, disclosure and reporting, regardless of whether new laws or regulations governing our industry are adopted. This increased attention may significantly increase the compliance costs for our businesses, result in additional fines or monetary penalties or settlements due to future government investigations, and materially and adversely impact the manner in which they operate, which may be materially adverse to several aspects of our performance.In addition, certain aspects of our businesses, such as the content of their advertising and other disclosures to customers about transactions, their respective data collection practices, the manner in which they may contact their customers, the decisioning process regarding whether to enter into a transaction with a potential customer, their credit reporting practices, and the manner in which they process and store certain customer, employee and other information are subject to federal and state laws and regulatory oversight. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the ""CCPA"") gives residents of California expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used, and also provides for civil penalties for violations and private rights of action for data breaches. In addition, the California Privacy Rights Act (""CPRA""), which became effective on January 1, 2023, significantly modifies the CCPA, including by expanding consumers' rights with respect to certain personal information and creating a new state agency to oversee implementation and enforcement efforts. The CCPA, CPRA, and other applicable state and federal privacy laws now require us to design, implement and maintain different types of privacy-related compliance controls and programs for our businesses simultaneously in multiple states, thereby further increasing the complexity and cost of compliance. In addition, certain states' laws limit the total cost that Progressive Leasing may charge a customer in order for the customer to achieve ownership of the leased merchandise at the end of the lease term.We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial costs to comply with federal, state and local laws and regulations, including rapidly evolving expected consumer protection standards. In addition to compliance costs, we may continue to incur substantial expenses to respond to regulatory and other third-party investigations and enforcement actions, proposed fines and 13penalties, criminal or civil sanctions, and private litigation, as well as potential ""headline risks"" that may negatively impact our business and may adversely affect our share price. Consumer complaints with respect to our industry have resulted in, and may in the future result in, state, federal and local regulatory and other investigations. In addition, while we are not aware of any whistleblower claims regarding the specific practices of our businesses, such claims are on the rise generally. We believe these claims will likely continue, in part because of the provisions enacted by the Dodd-Frank Act that provide for cash awards to persons who report alleged wrongdoing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and because competitors may use it as a method to weaken their competitors, and others, like former personnel or other constituencies, may use it as means to extract payment or otherwise retaliate.Additionally, as we execute on our strategic plans, we may continue to expand into complementary businesses that engage in financial, consumer credit transactions or lending services, or lease-to-own or rent-to-rent transactions involving products that we do not currently offer our customers, or implement the use of new technologies in our existing businesses and products, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence-based technologies, all of which may be subject to a variety of statutes, laws and regulatory requirements in addition to those regulations currently applicable to our operations, which may impose significant costs, limitations or prohibitions on the manner in which we currently conduct our businesses as well as those we may acquire in the future.Progressive Leasing serves subprime consumers, and its lease-to-own business model poses inherent risks that may have a material and adverse effect on our results, financial condition, and prospects.Progressive Leasing offers lease-to-own solutions to subprime consumers through point-of-sale retail partners via in-store, mobile, and online solutions. While this model allows Progressive Leasing to address an underserved, credit-challenged segment of the population with an innovative lease-to-own solution that integrates seamlessly with the traditional and e-commerce retailers with whom Progressive Leasing partners (whom we refer to as our point of sale or ""POS"" partners), it creates specific and unique risks including, among others:•reliance on POS partners (over whom Progressive Leasing does not exercise full control and oversight) for many important business functions, from advertising through assistance with lease transaction applications, including, for example, explaining the nature of the lease-to-own transaction when asked to do so by a consumer;•the potential that federal, state and local regulators will continue to focus on alternative financial services products, including consumer protection with respect to such products within the subprime financial marketplace, and impact lease-to-own transactions by adopting new regulations (or applying existing laws and regulations that were never intended to apply to lease-to-own transactions) that require Progressive Leasing to change its business practices in a materially adverse manner;•indemnification obligations to POS partners for losses stemming from, among other matters, Progressive Leasing's violation of federal, state or local laws or regulations or failure to take the appropriate steps to protect its POS partners' and customers' information from being accessed or stolen by unauthorized third parties through cyber-attacks or ""hacking"" or similar occurrences; and•reliance on automatic bank account drafts for lease payments, which may become disfavored as a payment method by regulators and/or providers, or may otherwise become unavailable.These risks, which may have a material and adverse effect on several aspects of our performance in the future, are described further below.Adverse macroeconomic conditions, such as inflation, a higher cost of living and elevated interest rates for extended periods, as well as other factors outside of our control, may adversely affect demand for our products and services and/or our customers' ability to make the payments they owe for such products and services.We derive our revenue from the products and services offered by our businesses. Adverse macroeconomic conditions, such as persistent inflationary pressures, the cost of living and elevated interest rates for extended periods, may lead to declines in disposable income and/or discretionary spending levels which, in turn, could reduce demand for our products and services. Other factors outside our control, such as potential changes in enforcement practices related to existing federal immigration policies and/or modified or newly adopted federal immigration policies, may also negatively affect the subprime consumer population and therefore the demand for our products and services. Additionally, adverse macroeconomic conditions or other factors outside of our control may unfavorably impact our customers' ability to make the payments they owe the Company which, in turn, could result in increased customer payment delinquencies, as well as increases in lease merchandise write-offs, loan loss provisioning and loan write-offs. As a result, continued macroeconomic uncertainty, or other factors outside of our control, could result in lower revenue and negatively impact our businesses and the Company's overall financial results.14In an uncertain macroeconomic environment, our proprietary algorithms and decisioning tools used in approving customers may no longer be indicative of their ability to perform, which in turn may limit the ability of our businesses to manage risk, avoid lease and loan charge-offs and may result in insufficient reserves to cover actual losses. We believe our proprietary lease and loan decisioning processes to be a key to the success of our businesses. These decisioning processes assume behavior and attributes observed for prior customers, among other factors, are indicative of performance by our future customers. Unexpected changes in customer behavior caused by uncertain macroeconomic conditions, including, for example, persistent inflationary pressures, strained consumer liquidity or increases in unemployment levels may lead to increased incidences and costs related to lease merchandise write-offs. In addition, we believe that uncertain macroeconomic conditions such as these lead to general declines in discretionary spending levels and disproportionately negatively impact the customers we serve. As a result, our decisioning process has required, and may in the future require, frequent adjustments (including tightening) and the application of greater management judgment in the interpretation of the results produced by our decisioning tools, which could have an unfavorable impact on our GMV, margins and earnings. These decisioning tools may be unable to accurately predict and respond to the impact of an uncertain macroeconomic environment or changes to customer behaviors in connection therewith, which in turn may limit the ability of our businesses to manage risk, avoid lease and loan charge-offs and may result in insufficient reserves to cover actual losses (which Progressive Leasing records as accounts receivable allowance and allowance for lease merchandise write-offs and Vive and Four record as provision for loan losses).A large percentage of Progressive Leasing's revenue is concentrated with several key POS partners, and the loss of any of these POS partner relationships would materially and adversely affect several aspects of our performance.Progressive Leasing's relationship with its largest POS partners will have a significant impact on our operating revenues in future periods. The loss of any key POS partners would have a material adverse effect on our business.For example, during 2024, we derived 52.6% of our consolidated revenues from customers of Progressive Leasing's top three POS partners, and 78.2% of our consolidated revenues from customers of Progressive Leasing's top ten POS partners. Any extended discontinuance of Progressive Leasing's relationship with any of those POS partners or other high visibility retailers, including as a result of such partners going out of business or otherwise being unable or unwilling to continue their relationships with Progressive Leasing, would have a material adverse impact on several aspects of our performance. For example, one our top ten POS partners, Big Lots, Inc., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in September 2024, which negatively impacted our financial performance in the fourth quarter of 2024 and is expected to negatively impact our financial performance for 2025.In addition, in the event that Progressive Leasing enters into new or amended business or contractual terms or conditions with any of its largest POS partners that are less favorable than its current arrangements with those POS partners, including with respect to the prices it pays those POS partners for merchandise that it leases to consumers and/or exclusivity, rebate or other incentive payments it may make to those POS partners, our business and prospects may be materially and adversely effected.Any publicity associated with the loss of any of Progressive Leasing's large POS partners may harm its reputation, making it more difficult to attract and retain consumers and other POS partners and could lessen its negotiating power with its remaining and prospective POS partners. Our operating revenues and operating results may also suffer if any of Progressive Leasing's POS partners experiences a significant decline in sales for any reason, including, for example, due to persistent inflationary pressures that reduce many consumers' discretionary incomes, the imposition of significant tariffs on imported goods that increase the prices of the products offered by our POS partners, or supply chain interruptions unfavorably impacting the inventories of our POS partners.There can be no assurance that Progressive Leasing will be able to continue its relationships with its largest POS partners on the same or more favorable terms in future periods or that its relationships will continue beyond the terms of its existing contracts with them. Our operating revenues and operating results may suffer if, among other things, any of Progressive Leasing's POS partners renegotiate, terminate or fail to renew, or fail to renew on similar or favorable terms, their agreements or otherwise choose to modify the level of support they provide for Progressive Leasing's products and services.If Progressive Leasing is unable to attract additional POS partners and retain and grow its relationships with its existing POS partners, several aspects of our performance would be materially and adversely affected.Our continued success is dependent on the ability of Progressive Leasing to maintain its relationship with its existing POS partners and grow its gross merchandise volume, or ""GMV"", (which we define as the retail price of merchandise acquired by Progressive Leasing, which we then lease to our customers) from those existing POS partners through their in-store and e-commerce platforms, and also to expand its POS partner base. Progressive Leasing's ability to retain and grow its relationships with POS partners depends on the willingness of POS partners to partner with it. The attractiveness of Progressive Leasing's platform to POS partners depends upon, among other things: its brand and reputation; its ability to sustain its value proposition to POS partners for consumer acquisition; the attractiveness to POS partners of its virtual and data-driven platform; the services, products and customer decisioning standards offered by Progressive Leasing's competitors; the amount of rebates or 15other incentive payments offered to those POS partners by Progressive Leasing, and its ability to perform under, and maintain, its POS partner agreements, most of which have terms that do not exceed three years.In addition, competition for smaller POS partners has intensified significantly in recent years, with many such POS partners simultaneously offering several products and services that compete directly with the products and services offered by Progressive Leasing. Having a diversified mix of POS partners is important to mitigate risk associated with changing consumer spending behavior, economic conditions and other factors that may affect a particular type of retailer. If Progressive Leasing fails to retain any of its larger POS partners or a substantial number of its smaller POS partners, if it does not acquire new POS partners, if it does not continually grow its GMV from its POS partners, or if it is not able to retain a diverse mix of POS partners, several aspects of our performance would be materially and adversely affected.If Progressive Leasing is unable to attract new consumers and retain and grow its relationships with its existing customers, several aspects of our performance would be materially and adversely affected. Our continued success depends on the ability of Progressive Leasing to generate repeat use and increased GMV from existing customers and to attract new consumers to its platform. Its ability to retain and grow its relationships with its customers depends on the willingness of consumers to use its products and services. The attractiveness of Progressive Leasing's data-driven platform to consumers depends upon, among other things: the number and variety of its POS partners and the mix of products and services available through its platform; its brand and reputation; customer experience and satisfaction; trust and perception of the value it provides; technological innovation; and the services, products and customer decisioning standards offered by its competitors. If Progressive Leasing fails to retain its relationship with existing customers, if it does not attract new consumers to its platform, products and services, or if it does not continually expand usage and GMV, including, for example, due to a failure to successfully and timely enhance the features of our existing products or create and launch innovative new products, several aspects of our performance would be materially and adversely affected.Although Vive and Four also serve subprime and near-prime consumers, their business models differ significantly from Progressive Leasing's lease-to-own business, which means each of these businesses have different risk profiles.Through its Vive branded credit cards and other private label credit card products, Vive offers POS partners a variety of revolving loans for subprime and near-prime consumers. Therefore, Vive's business model has specific and unique risks that are different from Progressive Leasing's business, which may disrupt Vive's business and/or have an unfavorable impact on Vive's financial performance, including, among others:•Vive's reliance on a limited number of bank partners to issue its Vive branded credit cards and other credit products. Vive's agreements with its issuing bank partners give those partners the right to terminate those agreements without cause by providing Vive with a non-renewal notice within a specified number of days prior to the dates on which those agreements are scheduled to automatically renew. If those agreements were terminated or otherwise disrupted, there is a risk that Vive would not be able to replace those banks with an alternative bank provider on terms that Vive would consider favorable or in a timely manner without disruption of its business.•Vive has significantly different regulatory risks as compared to Progressive Leasing, including those applicable to consumer credit card transactions. For example, Vive may have compliance obligations with respect to federal and state laws and regulations, including pursuant to its agreements with its issuing bank partners, that govern, among other areas, cardholder agreement terms and disclosures (e.g., the Truth In Lending Act), credit discrimination (e.g., the Equal Credit Opportunity Act), credit reporting (e.g., the Fair Credit Reporting Act), and servicing and collection activities.The risks that are specific to Vive may also have a material and adverse effect on several aspects of our performance in the future.In addition, through its BNPL offerings, Four's business model allows shoppers to pay for merchandise through four interest-free installments, which enables its customers to purchase furniture, clothing, electronics, health and beauty, footwear, jewelry, and other consumer goods from retailers across the United States. As discussed above, BNPL offerings have become subject to enhanced regulatory scrutiny by federal and state regulatory authorities which allege several areas of perceived risks to consumers, including the risks that borrowers will become overextended. For example, certain states, such as New York, have introduced legislation to enhance regulations applicable to BNPL offerings, including regulations that limit the amount of fees BNPL businesses are permitted to charge consumers, require BNPL businesses to obtain licenses to conduct business in such states, and require BNPL businesses to perform ""ability-to-repay"" analyses on their applicants. As a result, Four's regulatory compliance obligations appear to be evolving in certain jurisdictions, which creates unique risks that are different than those faced by more mature businesses, such as Progressive Leasing and Vive, and which could be materially adverse to Four.16Our efforts to modernize and enhance certain enterprise-wide information management systems and technologies could adversely impact our businesses and operations.We rely extensively on enterprise-wide information management systems and technologies to manage our businesses and, from time to time, we pursue opportunities to modernize and enhance these systems and technologies. For example, in fiscal 2025, we expect to begin implementing a new enterprise resource planning system that is intended to streamline and optimize the Company's financial and accounting processes, as well as begin implementing operational and technological enhancements to our lease decisioning and management systems that are intended to optimize performance, improve efficiency and enhance scalability. We also expect to migrate a large portion of our enterprise-wide applications to a third-party cloud provider in order to further enhance our business continuity and disaster recovery plans. These efforts may take longer and may require greater financial and other resources than anticipated, may cause distraction of key personnel, may cause disruptions to our existing systems and our business, may adversely impact our ability to externally report timely and accurate consolidated financial information, may expose us to heightened cybersecurity risks and may not otherwise provide the anticipated benefits. In addition, our inability to improve, upgrade, integrate or expand such systems and technologies to meet our evolving business requirements could impair our ability to achieve critical strategic initiatives and could materially and adversely affect several aspects of our performance.Our inability to protect confidential, proprietary, or sensitive information, including the confidential information of our customers, may be adversely affected by cyber-attacks or similar disruptions, which may result in significant costs, litigation and reputational damage or otherwise have a material adverse impact on several aspects of our performance. Our businesses collect, store, use, disclose, process and transfer (collectively, ""process"") a wide variety of information, including personally identifiable information, for various purposes, including to help ensure the integrity of their services and to provide features and functionality to their customers and POS partners. The processing of the information they acquire in connection with their customers' and POS partners' use of their services is subject to numerous privacy, data protection, cybersecurity, and other laws and regulations. The automated nature of their businesses and their reliance on digital technologies may make them an attractive target for, and potentially vulnerable to, cyber-attacks, computer malware, computer viruses, social engineering (including phishing and ransomware attacks), general hacking, physical or electronic break-ins, or similar disruptions. While they and their vendors have taken steps to protect the confidential, proprietary, and sensitive information to which they have access and to prevent data loss, their security measures or those of their vendors could be breached, including as a result of employee theft, exfiltration, misuse or malfeasance, their actions, omissions, or errors, third-party actions, omissions or errors, unintentional events, or deliberate attacks by cyber criminals, any of which may result in the loss of, or unauthorized access to, their or their customers' data, their intellectual property, or other confidential, proprietary, or sensitive business information. Any accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access to their platforms or servicing systems may cause confidential, proprietary, or sensitive information to be stolen and used for criminal or other unauthorized purposes. Security breaches or unauthorized access to confidential information may also expose our businesses to liability related to the loss of the information, time-consuming and expensive litigation and government investigations, enforcement actions and negative publicity. If security measures are breached for any of these reasons, the relationships our businesses have with their customers may be damaged, and significant liability could be incurred. Although we work hard to detect security breaches or instances of unauthorized access to confidential information, there is no guarantee that our monitoring efforts will be effective. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized, improper, or illegal access to our information technology systems are constantly evolving, may be difficult to detect quickly, and may not be recognized until after they have been launched. Unauthorized parties have in the past attempted and may in the future attempt to gain access to our information technology security systems through various means, including, among others, hacking into our or their POS partners' or customers' systems or facilities, or attempting to fraudulently induce employees, POS partners, customers or others into disclosing usernames, passwords, or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access systems and gain access to confidential, proprietary, or sensitive information. Such efforts may be state-sponsored and supported by significant financial and technological resources (such as evolving artificial intelligence tools), making them even more difficult to detect and prevent. As a result, there can be no assurance that the protections deployed by us will always be successful.For example, as we have previously disclosed, in September 2023, Progressive Leasing experienced a cybersecurity incident affecting certain of its systems. While there was no major operational impact to any of Progressive Leasing's services as a result of the incident, and our other subsidiaries were not impacted, this incident, as well as any other breach of our systems or facilities, or those of our other businesses, may continue to result in the risks discussed herein.Any actual or perceived failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our businesses, including those relating to information security, or any failure to protect the information that our businesses collect from their customers and POS partners, including personally identifiable information, may result in, among other things, regulatory or governmental investigations, administrative enforcement actions, sanctions, criminal liability, private litigation, civil liability and constraints on our ability to continue to operate.17Furthermore, federal and state regulators and many federal and state laws and regulations require notice of any data security breaches that involve personal information. These mandatory disclosures regarding a security breach are costly to implement and often lead to widespread negative publicity, which may cause consumers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our data security measures. Any security breach suffered by us or our vendors, any unauthorized, accidental, or unlawful access or loss of data, or the perception that any such event has occurred, may result in a disruption to our operations, litigation, an obligation to notify regulators and affected individuals, the triggering of indemnification and other contractual obligations, regulatory investigations, government fines and penalties, reputational damage, and loss of customers and ecosystem partners, and our business may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we may incur significant costs and operational consequences in connection with investigating, mitigating, remediating, eliminating, and putting in place additional tools and devices designed to prevent future actual or perceived security incidents, as well as in connection with complying with any notification or other obligations resulting from any security incidents. Our insurance policies carry retention and coverage limits, which may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches, and we may not be able to collect fully, if at all, under these insurance policies. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, may adversely affect our businesses. Furthermore, we cannot be certain that insurance coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or at all, or that the insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim, including claims related to the cybersecurity incident experienced by Progressive Leasing discussed above. Reduced confidence and participation in our platforms and our data security measures may also adversely affect customers' willingness to perform their obligations under their lease or loan, as the case may be, which could result in reduced collections.Our capital allocation strategy and financial policies, including our current stock repurchase and dividend programs, as well as any potential debt repurchase program may not be effective at enhancing shareholder value, or providing other benefits we expect. Although our capital allocation strategy and financial policies are intended to enhance shareholder value, lower our cost of capital and demonstrate our commitment to return excess capital to shareholders while maintaining our ability to invest in organic growth and strategic acquisition opportunities, there can be no assurance they will be effective.We have taken significant steps intended to better align our existing capital structure with our go-forward capital allocation strategy. For example, since the fourth quarter of 2021, we have repurchased approximately 29.9% of our outstanding shares, for an aggregate purchase price of $501.8 million, including the repurchase of approximately 8.0% of our outstanding shares, for an aggregate purchase price of $138.7 million, during the 2024 fiscal year. As of December 31, 2024, we had the authority to purchase additional shares up to our remaining authorization limit of $361.3 million. Additionally, in February 2024, our Board of Directors authorized the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend, and the Company has since paid a quarterly cash dividend to its shareholders for each fiscal quarter since the first quarter of the 2024 fiscal year.The timing and actual number of further share repurchases and/or the continuation of our dividend program following the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, if any, will depend on a variety of factors, including the price and availability of our shares, trading volume, our earnings and financial condition, general market conditions, and projected cash positions in light of other capital allocation opportunities such as organic growth and strategic acquisitions. The share repurchase program and/or the dividend program may be suspended or discontinued at any time in the future without prior notice.Repurchases under our share repurchase program will reduce the market liquidity for our stock, potentially affecting its trading volatility and price. Future share repurchases, dividend payments or any potential debt repurchases may also diminish our cash reserves, which may impact our ability to pursue organic growth and attractive strategic opportunities. Furthermore, there are other financial and operational risks associated with our capital allocation strategy and financial policies, including in the event that we implement a debt repurchase or dividend program, which are detailed more fully below. See ""Risks Related to Our Indebtedness.""Our businesses operate in highly and increasingly competitive industries, and their inability to compete successfully would materially and adversely affect several aspects of our performance.The industries in which our businesses operate are highly and increasingly competitive. For example, Progressive Leasing and Vive face competition from national, regional and local operators of lease-to-own stores, virtual lease-to-own companies, traditional and e-commerce retailers (including many that offer layaway programs and title or installment lending), traditional and online sellers of used merchandise, and various types of consumer finance companies that may enable our customers to shop at traditional or online retailers, as well as with rental stores that do not offer their customers a purchase option. Similarly, Four faces competition from other companies who offer buy now, pay later products, many of whom are larger than Four, in addition to some of the competitors mentioned above. These competitors may have significantly greater financial and operating resources, greater name recognition in certain markets and more developed products and services, which may allow them to grow faster, including through acquisitions, and to offer more aggressive exclusivity, rebate and/or other incentive payments to 18existing and potential POS partners, some of whom may be our POS partners. This in turn may enable these competitors to enter new markets, which may decrease opportunities for us in those markets. Greater name recognition, or better public perception of a competitor's reputation, may help the competitor divert market share, even in established markets. Some competitors may be willing to offer competing products on an unprofitable basis (or may have looser decisioning standards or be willing to relax their decisioning standards) in an effort to gain market share, which could compel us to match their pricing and/or decisioning strategy or lose business. In addition, some of Progressive Leasing's competitors may be willing to lease certain types of products that we will not agree to lease, enter into customer leases that have services, as opposed to goods, as a significant portion of the lease value, or engage in other practices related to pricing, aggressive rebates and other incentive payments to POS partners, compliance, and other areas that we will not, in an effort to gain market share at our expense. Our business relies heavily on relationships with POS partners. An increase in competition may cause our POS partners to no longer offer our product and services in favor of our competitors, or to offer our product and services and the products of our competitors simultaneously at the same store locations, which may slow growth in our business and limit or reduce profitability. Furthermore, our virtual lease-to-own competitors may deploy different business models, such as direct-to-consumer strategies, that forego reliance on POS partner relationships that may prove to be more successful.If Progressive Leasing fails to maintain a consistently high level of customer satisfaction and trust in its brand, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects would be materially and adversely affected.Offering an additional option for Progressive Leasing's customers to obtain the big-ticket merchandise they need is critical to its success. If consumers do not trust the Progressive Leasing brand or do not have a positive experience, they will not use its products and services. If consumers do not use Progressive Leasing's products and services, it will not be able to attract or retain POS partners. As a result, Progressive Leasing has invested heavily in both technology and its support team, including the utilization of third-party customer service call centers. If it is unable to consistently cultivate positive customer experiences, it will lose existing customers and POS partners. In addition, Progressive Leasing's ability to attract new consumers and POS partners is highly dependent on its reputation and on positive recommendations from its existing customers and POS partners. Any failure to consistently cultivate high-quality customer service, including as a result of actions or events beyond our control relating to the third-party call centers we utilize, or a market perception that it does not maintain high-quality customer service, would adversely affect its reputation and the number of positive customer referrals that it receives. As a result, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects would be materially and adversely affected.The transactions offered to consumers by our businesses may be negatively characterized by federal, state and local government officials, consumer advocacy groups and the media, and if those negative characterizations become increasingly accepted by consumers and/or others with whom we do business, several aspects of our performance may be materially and adversely affected. From time to time, the subprime financial marketplace in which our businesses generally operate garners the attention of federal, state and local government officials as well as consumer advocacy groups and the media. In addition, the business models and practices of other companies offering services similar to those we offer have become the subject of investigations and litigation by federal and state regulators. Legislative or regulatory proposals regarding our industry, or interpretations of them, may subject our businesses to ""headline risks"" that could negatively impact each of them in a particular market or in general and, therefore, may adversely affect our share price. In particular, and among other perceived concerns, advocacy groups have asserted (and are likely to continue asserting) that laws and regulations should be broader and more restrictive regarding lease-to-own transactions, such as those engaged in by Progressive Leasing. With respect to these transactions, consumer advocacy groups and media reports generally focus on the total cost to a consumer to acquire merchandise, which is often alleged to be higher than the interest typically charged by banks or similar lending institutions to consumers with better credit histories. This ""cost-of-rental"" amount, which is generally defined as lease fees paid in excess of the ""retail"" price of the merchandise, is from time to time characterized by consumer advocacy groups and media reports as predatory or abusive without discussing the benefits associated with lease-to-own programs. Moreover, they often allege noncompliance with current consumer protection regulations and violations of notions of fair dealing with consumers.Although we strongly disagree with these characterizations, if the negative characterization of these types of lease-to-own transactions becomes increasingly accepted by consumers or Progressive Leasing's POS partners and others with whom it does business, demand for its products and services may significantly decrease, which may have a material adverse effect on several aspects of our performance. Additionally, if the negative characterization of these types of transactions is accepted by government officials, Progressive Leasing may become subject to more restrictive laws and regulations and more stringent enforcement of existing laws and regulations, any of which may have a material adverse effect on several aspects of our performance. The vast expansion and reach of technology, including social media platforms, has increased the risk that our businesses' reputations may be significantly impacted by negative characterizations in a relatively short amount of time. If Progressive Leasing is unable to quickly and effectively respond to such characterizations, it may experience declines in customer loyalty and traffic and its relationships with its POS partners may suffer, which may have a material adverse effect on several aspects of our performance. Similarly, either Vive or Four's inability to timely and effectively respond to such 19characterizations may harm its relationships with its merchant partners and customers, and result in declines in transactions and revenue. Additionally, any failure by Progressive Leasing or by its competitors, including smaller, regional competitors, for example, to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to the traditional and/or virtual lease-to-own business models, or any actions by those competitors that are challenged by consumers, advocacy groups, the media or governmental agen",50000,rf,20250219,2025,10K,real_textdata_2025

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and (ii) ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis (""MD&A"") is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of PROG Holdings, Inc. and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Throughout the MD&A we refer to various notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements which appear in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors and ""Forward-Looking Statements"" of this Form 10-K.Business OverviewPROG Holdings, Inc. (""we,"" ""our,"" ""us,"" the ""Company,"" or ""PROG Holdings"") is a financial technology holding company that provides transparent and competitive payment options to consumers. PROG Holdings has two reportable segments: (i) Progressive Leasing, an in-store, app-based, and e-commerce point-of-sale lease-to-own solutions provider; and (ii) Vive Financial (""Vive""), an omnichannel provider of second-look revolving credit products.Our Progressive Leasing segment provides consumers with lease-purchase solutions through its point-of-sale partner locations and e-commerce website partners (collectively, ""POS partners""). It does so by purchasing merchandise from the POS partners desired by customers and, in turn, leasing that merchandise to the customers through a cancellable lease-to-own transaction. Progressive Leasing has no stores of its own, but rather offers lease-purchase solutions to the customers of traditional and e-commerce retailers. The Progressive Leasing segment comprised approximately 96% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024.Our Vive segment primarily serves customers that may not qualify for traditional prime lending offers who desire to purchase goods and services from participating merchants. Vive offers customized programs, with services that include revolving loans through private label and Vive-branded credit cards. Vive's current network of POS partner locations and e-commerce websites includes furniture, mattresses, home exercise equipment, and home improvement retailers, as well as medical and dental service providers. The Vive segment comprised approximately 3% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024.Four Technologies, Inc. (""Four""), is a Buy Now, Pay Later (""BNPL"") company that allows shoppers to pay for merchandise through four interest-free installments. Four's proprietary platform capabilities and its base of customers and retailers expand PROG Holdings' ecosystem of financial technology offerings by introducing a payment solution that further diversifies the Company's consumer financial technology offerings. Shoppers use Four to purchase furniture, clothing, electronics, health and beauty products, footwear, jewelry, and other consumer goods from retailers across the United States. Four is not a reportable segment for the year ended December 31, 2024 as its financial results are not significant to the Company's consolidated financial results. Four's financial results are reported within ""Other"" for segment reporting purposes.PROG Holdings also owns Build, a credit building financial management tool. Build is not a reportable segment in 2024 as its financial results are not significant to the Company's consolidated financial results. Build's financial results are reported within ""Other"" for segment reporting purposes.Macroeconomic and Business EnvironmentDuring 2024, the Company's lease application volume increased due to progress in executing our strategic growth initiatives, including direct-to-consumer and other enhanced marketing initiatives, e-commerce integrations with POS partners, customer experience technology improvements with certain POS partners, and also due to the tightening of the credit supply above Progressive Leasing. We believe these factors contributed to growth in Progressive Leasing's Gross Merchandise Volume (""GMV"") in the year ended December 31, 2024 when compared to the prior year, and will continue to have a favorable impact in 2025. Despite the increase in demand for our lease-to-own offerings, the Company continues to operate in a challenging macroeconomic environment. Due to inflationary pressures in recent years, the cost of living remains significantly higher than it was prior to 2020, particularly with respect to housing, food and gas costs. We believe the increased cost of living has had a disproportionate negative effect on the customers we serve and an unfavorable impact on our GMV and financial performance in 2024, and will continue to do so in 2025. We believe the persistent inflationary pressures, the cost of living and elevated interest rates for extended periods have also unfavorably impacted consumer confidence within our customer base, resulting in a decrease in demand for the types of merchandise offered by many of our key national and regional POS partners. For example, Big Lots, Inc., one of Progressive Leasing's ten largest POS partners filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in September 2024, resulting in the permanent closure of many of its stores. While we expect to implement a number of initiatives intended to 35offset the GMV loss arising out of Big Lots' bankruptcy, we believe that development will have a negative impact on Progressive Leasing's GMV and financial performance in 2025.In light of these macroeconomic challenges and to align the cost structure of our business with our near-term revenue outlook, the Company executed on a number of cost reduction initiatives beginning in 2022 and continuing into 2024, to drive efficiencies and right-size variable costs, while attempting to minimize the negative impact on growth-related initiatives.Customer payment delinquencies at the end of 2024 were elevated compared to the end of 2023, which contributed to the provision for lease merchandise write-offs as a percentage of lease revenues increasing to 7.5% for the year ended December 31, 2024 from 6.7% in the same period in 2023, but still within the Company's targeted annual range of 6% to 8%. Any meaningful increase in the unemployment rate or any further increase in inflation may result in increasing levels of customer payment delinquencies and related write-offs, which would result in an unfavorable impact on our performance.Cybersecurity IncidentDuring the third quarter of 2023, Progressive Leasing experienced a cybersecurity incident affecting certain data and IT systems of Progressive Leasing. Promptly after detecting the incident, the Company engaged third-party cybersecurity experts and took immediate steps to respond to, remediate and investigate the incident. Law enforcement was also notified. Based on the Company's investigation, the Company determined that the data involved in the incident contained a substantial amount of personally identifiable information, including social security numbers, of Progressive Leasing's customers and other individuals. With the assistance of cybersecurity experts, the Company located the Progressive Leasing customers and other individuals whose information was impacted and notified them, consistent with state and federal requirements. The Company also took a number of additional measures to demonstrate its continued support and commitment to data privacy and protection. As a result of this cybersecurity incident, Progressive Leasing has become subject to multiple lawsuits which allege, among other things, the incurrence of various types of damages arising out of the incident. All of these lawsuits have been consolidated into a single action in the United States District Court for the District of Utah (the ""District Court""). The plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint on April 19, 2024. On June 24, 2024, Progressive Leasing filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, which was granted in part and denied in part on January 16, 2025.Progressive Leasing intends to vigorously defend itself against the lawsuit; however, at this time, the Company is unable to determine or predict the outcome of this lawsuit or reasonably provide an estimate or range of the possible losses, if any. The Company also maintains cybersecurity insurance coverage, subject to a $1.0 million retention, to limit the exposure to losses and related costs and expenses, such as those related to the cybersecurity incident and lawsuits stemming therefrom; however, there can be no assurance that such insurance coverage will be adequate to cover all of the costs and expenses related thereto or that the insurers will agree to cover all such losses, costs and expenses.During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred $0.3 million and $2.8 million, respectively, for costs related to the cybersecurity incident, net of insurance proceeds. These costs related primarily to third-party legal and consulting services and credit monitoring services for Progressive Leasing's customers and employees that were impacted and are included within professional services expense as a component of operating expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings.36HighlightsThe following summarizes significant highlights from the year ended December 31, 2024: •We reported revenues of $2.5 billion in 2024, an increase of 2.3% compared to 2023. The increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in GMV at Four and Progressive Leasing in 2024 compared to the prior year. •GMV from our other operations increased by $200.5 million, or 198.3%, primarily due to an increase in loan originations for our Four business in 2024 compared to 2023. GMV increased by $130.5 million for Progressive Leasing in 2024, compared to 2023. The increase in GMV for Progressive Leasing was due to a combination of: (i) positive customer responses to our strategic initiatives, such as direct-to-consumer and other enhanced marketing initiatives, e-commerce integrations with our POS partners and customer experience technology improvements with certain POS partners, and (ii) increasing demand for our lease-to-own offering arising out of a tightening of the credit supply above Progressive Leasing, which resulted in an increase in lease applications when compared to 2023. •Earnings before income tax (benefit) expense decreased to $163.6 million compared to $196.2 million in 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by higher provisions for lease merchandise write-offs and loan losses, more customers choosing to exercise early buyout options, and increased restructuring expenses in 2024 compared to 2023. These decreases to earnings before income taxes were partially offset by lower personnel costs resulting from our cost reduction initiatives.Key Operating MetricsGross Merchandise Volume. We believe GMV is a key performance indicator of our Progressive Leasing and Vive segments, as it provides the total value of new leases and loans written into our portfolio over a specified time period. GMV does not represent revenues earned by the Company, but rather is a leading indicator we use in forecasting revenues the Company may earn. Progressive Leasing's GMV is defined as the retail price of merchandise acquired by Progressive Leasing, which it then expects to lease to its customers. GMV for Vive and Other are defined as gross loan originations. The following table presents our GMV for the Company for the years presented:For the Year Ended December 31 (Unaudited and In Thousands)202420232022Progressive Leasing$1,927,164 $1,796,647 $1,976,794 Vive141,093 143,541 178,002 Other301,568 101,099 60,459 Total GMV$2,369,825 $2,041,287 $2,215,255 The increase in Progressive Leasing's GMV was primarily due to a combination of: (i) positive customer responses to our strategic initiatives, such as direct-to-consumer and other enhanced marketing initiatives, e-commerce integrations with our POS partners and customer experience technology improvements with certain POS partners, and (ii) increasing demand for our lease-to-own offering arising out of a tightening of the credit supply above Progressive Leasing, which resulted in an increase in lease applications when compared to 2023. E-commerce channels generated 17.0% of Progressive Leasing's GMV in 2024 compared to 16.9% in 2023. The increase in GMV from our other operations was primarily due to an increase in loan originations by our Four business. GMV for Vive remained consistent year over year.Active Customer Count. Our active customer count represents the total number of customers that have an active lease agreement with Progressive Leasing, or an active loan with Vive or our other operations. Active customer counts include customers that may have an active lease or loan agreement with more than one segment. The following table presents our active customer count for each segment and Other:As of December 31 (Unaudited and In Thousands)202420232022Active Customer Count:Progressive Leasing934 893 943 Vive90 86 92 Other252 113 39 The number of customers for Progressive Leasing was higher in 2024, compared to the prior year, due to favorable customer responses to our strategic initiatives, including enhanced marketing, e-commerce integrations with POS partners, customer experience technology improvements with certain POS partners, and to a lesser extent, a tightening of the credit supply above Progressive Leasing. The number of customers for Vive has remained essentially flat. The increase in the number of customers for Other was the result of continued growth in our other strategic businesses.37Key Components of Earnings Before Income Tax (Benefit) ExpenseIn this MD&A section, we review our consolidated results. For the year ended December 31, 2024 and the comparable prior year periods, some of the key revenue, cost and expense items that affected earnings before income taxes were as follows:Revenues. We separate our total revenues into two components: (i) lease revenues and fees and (ii) interest and fees on loans receivable. Lease revenues and fees include all revenues derived from lease agreements from our Progressive Leasing segment. Lease revenues are recorded net of a provision for uncollectible renewal payments. Interest and fees on loans receivable represents merchant fees, finance charges and annual and other fees earned on outstanding loans in our Vive segment and, to a lesser extent, from our Four business.Depreciation of Lease Merchandise. Depreciation of lease merchandise reflects the expense associated with depreciating merchandise leased to customers by Progressive Leasing.Provision for Lease Merchandise Write-offs. The provision for lease merchandise write-offs represents the estimated merchandise losses incurred but not yet identified by management and adjustments for changes in estimates for the allowance for lease merchandise write-offs.Operating Expenses. Operating expenses include personnel costs, stock-based compensation expense, occupancy costs, advertising, decisioning expense, professional services expense, sales acquisition expense, computer software expense, bank service charges, the provision for loan losses, fixed asset depreciation expense, intangible asset amortization, and restructuring expense, among other expenses.Impairment of Goodwill. Impairment of goodwill is the partial write-off of the goodwill balance at the Four reporting unit.

This increase was partially offset by having a smaller lease portfolio at the beginning of 2024 as compared to the beginning of 2023. Vive revenues declined primarily due to a smaller loan portfolio throughout 2024 as compared to 2023, as a result of lower demand for products offered by certain Vive POS partners. The increase to Other revenue was primarily driven by a 198.3% increase in Four's GMV as compared to the same period in 2023, due to increased loan originations.39Operating ExpensesInformation about certain significant components of operating expenses is as follows:Change Year Ended December 31,2024 vs. 2023(In Thousands)20242023$%Personnel Costs1$172,542 $187,199 $(14,657)(7.8)%Stock-Based Compensation 29,179 24,920 4,259 17.1 Occupancy Costs4,199 5,429 (1,230)(22.7)Advertising20,102 17,203 2,899 16.9 Professional Services32,277 26,882 5,395 20.1 Sales Acquisition Expense229,175 28,205 970 3.4 Computer Software Expense328,057 26,673 1,384 5.2 Bank Service Charges11,042 11,246 (204)(1.8)Other Sales, General and Administrative Expense36,969 38,005 (1,036)(2.7)Sales, General and Administrative Expense363,542 365,762 (2,220)(0.6)Provision for Loan Losses55,950 40,757 15,193 37.3 Depreciation and Amortization26,977 32,032 (5,055)(15.8)Restructuring Expense22,691 12,533 10,158 81.1 Operating Expenses$469,160 $451,084 $18,076 4.0 %1 Personnel costs excludes stock-based compensation expense, which is reported separately in the operating expense table.2 Sales acquisition expense includes vendor incentives and rebates to POS partners, external sales commissions, amortization of initial direct costs and amounts paid to various POS partners to be their exclusive provider of lease-to-own solutions.3 Computer software expense consists primarily of software subscription fees, licensing fees and non-capitalizable software implementation costs.The $14.7 million decrease in personnel costs was due to a decrease of $13.3 million at Progressive Leasing attributable to its reduction in the number of employees during the second half of 2023 and first quarter of 2024 as part of its restructuring and cost cutting initiatives. Personnel costs at Vive also decreased by $1.4 million compared to 2023.Stock-based compensation increased $4.3 million compared to 2023, consisting of increases of $5.3 million at Progressive Leasing and $0.2 million at Vive, partially offset by a decrease of $1.2 million at Four. The higher stock-based compensation in 2024 was the result of: (i) an increase in the grant date value of restricted stock units granted in 2024 compared to 2023; and (ii) an increase to the estimated payout of performance stock units granted in 2024 based on the Company's actual results, compared to a lower payout of performance stock units granted in 2023. The lower stock-based compensation at Four in 2024 compared to 2023, was a result of the Company determining in the second quarter of 2024 that performance stock units that had been granted to Four executives in 2021 and 2022 were no longer probable of being earned.Advertising expense increased $2.9 million compared to 2023, primarily due to increased advertising in the Progressive Leasing segment associated with the expansion of our direct-to-consumer marketing efforts.Professional services increased $5.4 million compared to 2023, primarily due to higher technology-related costs. Professional services in the prior year were also impacted by the benefit of $0.5 million of regulatory insurance recoveries that were received during the first quarter of 2023.The provision for loan losses increased $15.2 million compared to 2023. The increase was primarily the result of a $14.0 million increase in the provision for loan losses for our Other operations, due to the continued growth of our Four business and our other strategic operations. The provision for loan losses at Vive also increased $1.2 million due to higher delinquencies compared to 2023.Depreciation and amortization decreased $5.1 million compared to 2023, primarily due to a decrease of $5.7 million at Progressive Leasing and $0.1 million at Vive, partially offset by an increase of $0.7 million at Four and other strategic businesses. The decrease at Progressive Leasing was primarily attributable to a technology asset that was fully amortized during the second quarter of 2024, as well as assets that were impaired as part of the Company's restructuring activities during the first quarter of 2024. The increase at Four and other strategic businesses was due to an increase in depreciable assets as compared to 2023.In 2024, restructuring expense included $7.8 million associated with the early termination of an independent sales agent agreement for Progressive Leasing, $2.0 million associated with the early termination of a third party vendor agreement within other strategic operations, $6.0 million of operating lease right-of-use asset and other fixed asset impairment charges related to 40the reduction of Progressive Leasing office space, and $6.8 million of employee severance for Progressive Leasing, Vive, and Other operations. In 2023, restructuring expense included $9.6 million associated with the early termination of certain independent sales agent agreements and $2.9 million of employee severance within Progressive Leasing.Other Costs and ExpensesDepreciation of lease merchandise. Depreciation of lease merchandise increased by 2.8% during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023. The increase was primarily due to growth in the Company's lease portfolio, resulting from positive customer responses to our strategic initiatives and increasing demand for our lease-to-own offering. As a percentage of lease revenues and fees, depreciation of lease merchandise increased to 68.5% from 67.5% in the prior year period, primarily due to a normalized level of early buyouts during 2024 as compared to a lower level of early buyouts during 2023.Provision for lease merchandise write-offs. The provision for lease merchandise write-offs increased by $23.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to 2023. The provision for lease merchandise write-offs as a percentage of lease revenues increased to 7.5% for the year ended December 31, 2024 from 6.7% for the prior year. The increase in the provision was a result of higher delinquencies and write-offs in 2024 compared to 2023. Given the significant economic uncertainty resulting from a higher cost of living, inflationary pressures, impact of tariffs, and increased interest rates for an extended period, and the potential effects of such developments on Progressive Leasing's POS partners, customers, and business going forward, a high level of estimation was involved in determining the allowance as of December 31, 2024. Actual lease merchandise write-offs could differ materially from the allowance for those write-offs.Interest expense, net.

Income Tax (Benefit) ExpenseIncome tax (benefit) expense was a benefit of $33.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to an expense of $57.4 million in 2023. The effective tax rate was (20.6)% for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 29.2% in 2023. The income tax benefit and negative effective tax rate in 2024 was primarily due to a $51.4 million non-cash reversal of the uncertain tax position related to Progressive Leasing and a $27.6 million deferred tax benefit related to an election which resulted in the deemed liquidation of a wholly-owned partnership for tax purposes.41Results of Operations – Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 Change Year Ended December 31,2023 vs. 2022(In Thousands)20232022$%REVENUES:Lease Revenues and Fees$2,333,588 $2,523,785 $(190,197)(7.5)%Interest and Fees on Loans Receivable74,676 74,041 635 0.9 2,408,264 2,597,826 (189,562)(7.3)COSTS AND EXPENSES:Depreciation of Lease Merchandise1,576,303 1,757,730 (181,427)(10.3)Provision for Lease Merchandise Write-offs155,250 193,926 (38,676)(19.9)Operating Expenses451,084 450,374 710 0.2 Impairment of Goodwill— 10,151 (10,151)nmf2,182,637 2,412,181 (229,544)(9.5)OPERATING PROFIT225,627 185,645 39,982 21.5 Interest Expense, Net(29,406)(37,401)7,995 21.4EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAX EXPENSE196,221 148,244 47,977 32.4 INCOME TAX EXPENSE57,383 49,535 7,848 15.8 NET EARNINGS$138,838 $98,709 $40,129 40.7 %nmf—Calculation is not meaningfulRevenuesInformation about our revenues by source and reportable segment is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2023Year Ended December 31, 2022(In Thousands)Progressive LeasingViveOtherTotalProgressive LeasingViveOtherTotalLease Revenues and Fees$2,333,588 $— $— $2,333,588 $2,523,785 $— $— $2,523,785 Interest and Fees on Loans Receivable— 68,912 5,764 74,676 — 70,911 3,130 74,041 Total Revenues$2,333,588 $68,912 $5,764 $2,408,264 $2,523,785 $70,911 $3,130 $2,597,826 The decrease in Progressive Leasing revenues was primarily the result of having a smaller lease portfolio at the beginning of and throughout 2023, as compared to the same periods in 2022. The decrease was also a result of a decline in Progressive Leasing's GMV for the year ended 2023, as compared to 2022, resulting from decreased customer demand for many of the products offered by our POS partners and tightened lease decisioning beginning in mid-2022. The decline in revenues was partially offset by improved customer payment activity in 2023, as compared to 2022. Vive revenues declined due to a 19.4% decrease in GMV as compared to 2022, resulting in a smaller loan portfolio throughout 2023. The increase in Other revenue was primarily driven by a 67.2% increase in Four's GMV as compared to the same period in 2022.42Operating ExpensesInformation about certain significant components of operating expenses is as follows:Change Year Ended December 31,2023 vs. 2022(In Thousands)20232022$%Personnel Costs1$187,199 $194,195 $(6,996)(3.6)%Stock-Based Compensation24,920 17,521 7,399 42.2 Occupancy Costs5,429 6,466 (1,037)(16.0)Advertising17,203 15,762 1,441 9.1 Professional Services26,882 22,824 4,058 17.8 Sales Acquisition Expense228,205 28,828 (623)(2.2)Computer Software Expense326,673 27,629 (956)(3.5)Bank Service Charges11,246 12,491 (1,245)(10.0)Other Sales, General and Administrative Expense38,005 40,574 (2,569)(6.3)Sales, General and Administrative Expense365,762 366,290 (528)(0.1)Provision for Loan Losses40,757 41,232 (475)(1.2)Depreciation and Amortization32,032 33,851 (1,819)(5.4)Restructuring Expense12,533 9,001 3,532 39.2 Operating Expenses$451,084 $450,374 $710 0.2 %1 Personnel costs excludes stock-based compensation expense, which is reported separately in the operating expense table.2 Sales acquisition expense includes vendor incentives and rebates to POS partners, external sales commissions, amortization of initial direct costs and amounts paid to various POS partners to be their exclusive provider of lease-to-own solutions.3 Computer software expense consists primarily of software subscription fees, licensing fees and non-capitalizable software implementation costs.The $7.0 million decrease in personnel costs was due to a decrease of $9.1 million at Progressive Leasing attributable to its reduction in the number of employees during the second half of 2022 as part of its restructuring and cost cutting initiatives. Personnel costs for Four and other strategic businesses also decreased by $0.1 million as compared to 2022. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $2.2 million at Vive primarily due to increased salaries and wages for new and existing employees.Stock-based compensation increased $7.4 million compared to 2022, consisting of increases of $4.7 million at Progressive Leasing, $1.9 million at Four and other strategic businesses, and $0.8 million at Vive. The lower stock-based compensation in 2022 was the result of: (i) the Company determining in the second quarter of 2022 that performance stock units that had been granted to Four executives were no longer probable of being earned resulting in lower expense in 2022 compared to 2023; (ii) no stock-based compensation expense being recognized for Progressive Leasing performance stock units granted in 2022 as the performance metrics related to those performance stock units were not met; and (iii) other stock-based forfeitures in 2022 related to the Progressive Leasing restructuring program. During 2023, the estimated payout of performance stock units granted in 2023 exceeded target based on the Company's actual results, further increasing the stock-based compensation expense during 2023 versus 2022.Professional services expense increased $4.1 million, consisting of $3.2 million at Progressive Leasing, $0.8 million at Four and other strategic businesses and $0.1 million at Vive. The increase at Progressive Leasing was primarily due to costs incurred related to the cybersecurity incident during the third quarter of 2023. The remaining increases were the result of increased expenses for other legal services and contract labor compared to 2022.Restructuring expense increased $3.5 million due to additional actions taken during the year ended December 31, 2023. In 2023, restructuring costs included $9.6 million associated with the early termination of certain independent sales agent agreements and $2.9 million of employee severance within Progressive Leasing. In 2022, restructuring costs included $5.6 million of employee severance within Progressive Leasing, $3.3 million of operating lease right-of-use asset and other fixed asset impairment charges related to the relocation of the Vive corporate headquarters and a reduction of Progressive Leasing management and information technology office space, and $0.1 million of other restructuring expenses.43Other Costs and ExpensesDepreciation of lease merchandise. Depreciation of lease merchandise decreased by 10.3% during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the size of Progressive Leasing's lease portfolio, resulting from tightening of its decisioning in mid-2022 and decreased consumer demand for many of the leasable products offered by Progressive Leasing's retail partners. As a percentage of total lease revenues and fees, depreciation of lease merchandise decreased to 67.5% from 69.6% in the prior year period, primarily due to improved customer payment activity and lower early buyouts for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the same period in 2022.Provision for lease merchandise write-offs. The provision for lease merchandise write-offs decreased by $38.7 million due to a reduction in the size of Progressive Leasing's lease portfolio and improved customer payment activity during the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the same period in 2022. The provision for lease merchandise write-offs as a percentage of lease revenues decreased to 6.7% for the year ended December 31, 2023 from 7.7% in the same period in 2022. The decrease in the provision as a percentage of lease revenues was a result of improved customer payment activity and lower write-offs due to the Company tightening its lease decisioning in mid-2022. Given the significant economic uncertainty resulting from inflation, elevated interest rates for extended periods, the resumption of student loan payments in October 2023, and the potential effects of such developments on Progressive Leasing's customers, and business going forward, a high level of estimation was involved in determining the allowance as of December 31, 2023. Actual lease merchandise write-offs could differ materially from the allowance for those write-offs.Impairment of Goodwill. The Company recorded a loss of $10.2 million to partially write off the goodwill balance of the Four reporting unit during the third quarter of 2022.Interest expense, net.

Factors impacting the change in earnings before income tax expense for each reporting segment are discussed above.Income Tax ExpenseIncome tax expense increased to $57.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $49.5 million in 2022 primarily due to higher earnings before income tax expense in 2023 as compared to prior year. The effective tax rate was 29.2% for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 33.4% in 2022. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by the non-deductible goodwill impairment loss for Four of $10.2 million that occurred in 2022, and the increase in the valuation allowance related to certain deferred tax assets that occurred in 2022.44Overview of Financial PositionThe major changes in the consolidated balance sheet from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024 include:•Cash and cash equivalents decreased $59.7 million to $95.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024.

Four's GMV increased 198.3% in 2024 as compared to 2023.•Income tax receivable decreased $22.3 million primarily due to a net decrease in tax payments made during the year ended December 31, 2024.•Prepaid expenses and other assets increased $27.5 million due primarily to upfront vendor incentives paid to certain Progressive Leasing POS partners in 2024.•Accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased $58.2 million due primarily to the reversal of the uncertain tax position, including interest, related to Progressive Leasing's $175.0 million settlement with the FTC in 2020.•Debt, net increased $51.3 million due to a $50.0 million draw on our Revolving Facility in December 2024, and the amortization of deferred financing costs. The $50.0 million draw was subsequently repaid in January 2025.•Deferred tax assets increased $23.5 million and deferred tax liabilities decreased $30.5 million, due primarily to an election which resulted in the deemed liquidation of a wholly-owned partnership for tax purposes.45Liquidity and Capital ResourcesGeneralWe expect that our primary capital requirements will consist of:•Reinvesting in our business, including buying merchandise for the operations of Progressive Leasing. Because we believe Progressive Leasing will continue to grow over the long-term, we expect that the need for additional lease merchandise will remain a major capital requirement; •Making merger and acquisition investment(s) to further broaden our product offerings; and•Returning excess cash to shareholders through periodically repurchasing stock and/or paying dividends.Other capital requirements include (i) expenditures related to software development; (ii) expenditures related to our corporate operating activities; (iii) personnel expenditures; (iv) income tax payments; (v) funding of loans receivable for Vive and Four; and (vi) servicing our outstanding debt obligations.Our capital requirements have been financed through:•cash flows from operations;•private debt offerings;•bank debt; and•stock offerings.As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $95.7 million of cash, $300.0 million of availability under the Revolving Facility, and $650.0 million of gross indebtedness. Cash Provided by Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities was $138.5 million and $204.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The $65.7 million decrease in operating cash flows was primarily driven by a $129.3 million increase in cash used for purchases of lease merchandise as a result of higher GMV at Progressive Leasing, an increase in the balance of accounts receivable due to timing of payments received from customers, and an increase in payments made on accounts payable and accrued expenses compared to December 31, 2023. These decreases in cash provided by operating activities were offset primarily by a decrease in cash paid for taxes of $50.6 million when compared to the prior year.Cash provided by operating activities was $204.2 million and $242.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The $38.3 million decrease in operating cash flows was primarily driven by a $190.2 million decrease in lease revenue resulting from a smaller lease portfolio and a $38.3 million increase in cash paid for income taxes compared to 2022. These decreases were partially offset by a $168.1 million decrease in purchases of lease merchandise, an increase in the balance of accounts payable and accrued expenses compared to December 31, 2022, improved customer payment activity during 2023, and an increase in interest income resulting from an increase in deposits in higher yield accounts. Other changes in cash provided by operating activities are discussed above in our discussion of results for the year ended December 31, 2023.Cash Used in Investing ActivitiesCash used in investing activities was $79.2 million and $38.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The $40.4 million increase in investing cash outflows was primarily the result of a $244.8 million increase in cash outflows for investments in loans receivable, partially offset by a $203.4 million increase in proceeds from loans receivable. These increases are primarily the result of growth of loan activity at Four.Cash used in investing activities was $38.8 million and $53.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The $14.7 million decrease in investing cash outflows was primarily the result of a $25.3 million increase in proceeds from loans receivable, partially offset by a $11.1 million increase in cash outflows for investments in loans receivable.Cash Used In Financing ActivitiesCash used in financing activities was $119.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $141.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of $22.8 million. The decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily the result of a $50.0 million draw on our revolving credit facility. This decrease in cash used was partially offset by a $20.4 million increase in cash paid for dividends, as the Company began paying dividends during 2024.Cash used in financing activities was $141.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $227.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of $85.3 million. Cash used in financing activities in 2023 was primarily for the Company's repurchase of $139.6 million of its common stock, compared to $223.6 million of share repurchases in 2022. The Company also used cash for an immaterial amount of debt issuance costs in 2023 compared to $1.6 million in 2022.Share RepurchasesWe purchase our stock in the market from time to time as authorized by our Board of Directors. Effective November 3, 2021, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program that provided the Company with the ability to repurchase shares up to a maximum amount of $1 billion. On February 21, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors reauthorized the repurchase of Company common stock at an aggregate purchase price of up to $500 million under the Company's existing share repurchase program, with such reauthorized share repurchase program to be extended for a period of three years from February 21, 2024, or until the $500 million aggregate purchase price of Company common stock purchased pursuant to the reauthorized share repurchase program has been met, whichever occurs first. As of December 31, 2024, we had the authority to purchase additional shares up to our remaining authorization limit of $361.3 million.The Company purchased 3,480,871 shares of its common stock for $138.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, 4,691,274 shares for $139.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, and 8,720,223 shares for $223.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. These amounts do not include any excise tax that may be assessed on those repurchases.DividendsWe declared and paid a dividend of $0.12 per share in each quarter of 2024, which resulted in aggregate dividend payments of $20.4 million. We paid no dividends during 2023 and 2022. While we expect to continue paying quarterly cash dividends in future periods, the future payment of dividends, if permitted, will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our capital allocation strategy at that time as well as other factors, including our earnings, financial condition, and other considerations that our Board of Directors deems relevant.Debt FinancingOn November 24, 2020, the Company entered into a credit agreement with a consortium of lenders providing for a $350 million senior revolving credit facility (the ""Revolving Facility""). On November 15, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment to the Revolving Facility, the primary purpose of which was to extend the maturity date of the Revolving Facility from November 24, 2025 to November 15, 2029.The Revolving Facility includes an uncommitted incremental facility increase option (""Incremental Facilities"") which, subject to certain terms and conditions, permits the Company at any time prior to the maturity date to request an increase in extensions of credit available thereunder by an aggregate additional principal amount of up to $300 million. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $50.0 million outstanding and $300 million remaining available for borrowings on the Revolving Facility. The Company repaid the $50.0 million Revolving Facility borrowing in January 2025.The Revolving Facility is fully secured and contains certain financial covenants, which include requirements that the Company maintain ratios of (i) total net debt to EBITDA of no more than 2.50:1.00 and (ii) consolidated interest coverage of no less than 3.00:1.00. The Company will be in default under the Revolving Facility if it fails to comply with these covenants, and all borrowings outstanding may become due immediately. As of December 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants set forth in the Revolving Facility and believes it will continue to be in compliance in the future.On November 26, 2021, the Company entered into an indenture in connection with its offering of $600 million aggregate principal amount of its senior unsecured notes due 2029 (the ""Senior Notes""). The Senior Notes were issued at 100.0% of their par value with a stated fixed annual interest rate of 6.00%. Interest accrues on the outstanding balance and is payable semi-annually. The Senior Notes are general unsecured obligations of the Company and are guaranteed by certain of the Company's existing and future domestic subsidiaries.The indenture discussed above contains various other covenants and obligations to which the Company and its subsidiaries are subject while the Senior Notes are outstanding. The covenants in the indenture may limit the extent to which, or the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to, among other things: (i) incur additional debt and guarantee debt; (ii) pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem capital stock; (iii) prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt; (iv) issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities; (v) make loans and investments; (vi) sell assets; (vii) incur liens; (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates; (ix) enter into agreements restricting the ability of the Company's subsidiaries to pay dividends; and (x) consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of the Company's assets. The indenture also contains customary events of default for transactions of this type and amount. The Company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2024 and believes that it will continue to be in compliance in the future.46CommitmentsIncome Taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we made net income tax payments of $49.8 million. During the year ended December 31, 2025 we anticipate making estimated cash payments of $67.0 million for United States federal and state income taxes.Leases. We lease management and information technology space for corporate functions under operating leases expiring at various times through 2028. Our corporate and segment management office leases contain renewal options for additional periods ranging from three to five years. Approximate future minimum payments for operating leases that have initial or remaining non-cancelable terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 2024 are disclosed in Note 6 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.Contractual Obligations and Commitments. Future interest payments on the Company's variable-rate debt are based on a rate per annum equal to, at our option, (i) the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR"") plus a margin within the range of 1.5% to 2.5% for revolving loans, based on total leverage, or (ii) the administrative agent's base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.5% to 1.5%, as specified in the agreement. Future interest payments related to our Revolving Facility are based on the borrowings outstanding at that time. Future interest payments may be different depending on future borrowing activity and interest rates. The Company had $50.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Facility as of December 31, 2024.As discussed above, on November 26, 2021, the Company issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes that bear a fixed annual interest rate of 6.00%. Interest will accrue on the outstanding balance and will be payable semi-annually. The Senior Notes will mature on Novembe",49990,mgmt,20250219,2025,10K,real_textdata_2025

Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and include, but are not limited to: •our ability to consummate the planned divestiture of our Fluid Handling business, the effect of recently announced acquisitions and the planned divestiture of our Fluid Handling Business (together, the “transactions”) on business relationships, operating results, and business generally, disruption of current plans and operations and potential difficulties in employee retention as a result of the transactions, diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business operations in connection with the integration of recent acquisitions, the outcome of any legal proceedings that have been or may in the future be instituted related to the Profire Energy, Inc. (""Profire Energy"") transaction or other transactions, the amount of the costs, fees, expenses and other charges related to the transactions, the achievement of the anticipated benefits of transactions, our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and realize the synergies from acquisitions, as well as a number of factors related to our business, including the sensitivity of our business to economic and financial market conditions generally and economic conditions in CECO’s service areas; •dependence on fixed price contracts and the risks associated therewith, including actual costs exceeding estimates and method of accounting for revenue; •the effect of growth on our infrastructure, resources and existing sales; •the ability to expand operations in both new and existing markets; •the potential for contract delay or cancellation as a result of on-going or worsening supply chain challenges, or other customer-driven project delays relating to supply chain challenges or other customer considerations; •liabilities arising from faulty services or products that could result in significant professional or product liability, warranty or other claims; •changes in or developments with respect to any litigation or investigation; •failure to meet timely completion or performance standards that could result in higher cost and reduced profits or, in some cases, losses on projects; •the potential for fluctuations in prices for manufactured components and raw materials, including as a result of tariffs and surcharges, and rising energy costs; •inflationary pressures relating to rising raw material costs and the cost of labor; •the substantial amount of debt incurred in connection with our strategic transactions and our ability to repay or refinance it or incur additional debt in the future; •the impact of federal, state or local government regulations; •our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock and the amounts and timing of repurchases; •our ability to successfully realize the expected benefits of our restructuring program; •economic and political conditions generally; •our ability to optimize our business portfolio by identifying acquisition targets, executing upon any strategic acquisitions or divestitures, integrating acquired businesses and realizing the synergies from strategic transactions; and •unpredictability and severity of catastrophic events, including cybersecurity threats, acts of terrorism or outbreak of war or hostilities or public health crises, as well as management’s response to any of the aforementioned factors. 1 Many of these risks are beyond management’s ability to control or predict. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any related assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material aspects from those currently anticipated. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements as they speak only to our views as of the date the statement is made. Except as required under the federal securities laws or the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), we undertake no obligation to update or review any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 2 Item 1A. Risk Factors An investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risk factors described below, together with the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before you decide to invest in our securities. The risks described below are the material risks of which we are currently aware; however, they may not be the only risks that we may face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently view as immaterial may also impair our business. Although the risks are organized by headings, and each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated. If any of these risks develop into actual events, it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and the trading price of your shares could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment. Risks Related to Our Business and Industry Our business may be adversely affected by global economic conditions. A national or global economic downturn or credit crisis may have a significant negative impact on our financial condition, future results of operations and cash flows. Specific risk factors related to these overall economic and credit conditions include the following: •customers or potential customers may reduce or delay their procurement or new product development; •key suppliers may have difficulties resulting in delays for our material purchases; •vendors, suppliers and other third parties may fail to perform their contractual obligations; and •customers may become insolvent and/or unable to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products and services. These risk factors could reduce our product sales, increase our operating costs, impact our ability to collect customer receivables, lengthen our cash conversion cycle and increase our need for cash, which would ultimately decrease our profitability and negatively impact our financial condition. They could also limit our ability to expand through acquisitions due to the tightening of the credit markets. Our dependence upon fixed-price contracts could adversely affect our operating results. The majority of our projects are currently performed on a fixed-price basis, while a limited number of projects are currently performed on a time and materials basis. Under a fixed-price contract, we agree on the price that we will receive for the entire project, based upon a defined scope, which includes specific assumptions and project criteria. If our estimates of the costs to complete the project are below the actual costs that we incur, our margins will decrease, or we may incur a loss. The revenue, cost and gross profit realized on a fixed-price contract will often vary from the estimated amounts because of unforeseen conditions or changes in job conditions and variations in labor and equipment productivity over the term of the contract. While our fixed-price contracts are typically not individually material to our operating results, if we are unsuccessful in mitigating these risks, we may realize gross profits that are different from those originally estimated and incur reduced profitability or losses on projects. Depending on the size of a project, these variations from estimated contract performance could have a significant effect on our operating results. In general, turnkey contracts to be performed on a fixed-price basis involve an increased risk of significant variations. Generally, our contracts and projects vary in length, depending on the size and complexity of the project, project owner demands and other factors. The foregoing risks are exacerbated for projects with longer-term durations and the inherent difficulties in estimating costs and of the interrelationship of the integrated services to be provided under these contracts whereby unanticipated costs or delays in performing part of the contract can have compounding effects by increasing costs of performing other parts of the contract. Accounting for contract revenue may result in material adjustments that would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from fixed price contracts. We recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and services. A significant amount of our revenue is recognized over a period of time as we perform under the contract because control of the work in process transfers continuously to the customer. For performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. Progress is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs to complete the performance obligation. For these contracts, the cost-to-cost measure best depicts the continuous transfer of goods or services to the customer. Contract revenue and total direct cost estimates are reviewed and revised periodically as the work progresses and as change orders are approved, and adjustments are reflected in contract revenue in the period when these estimates are revised. These estimates are based 11 on management’s reasonable assumptions and our historical experience, and are only estimates. Variation of actual results from these assumptions, which are outside the control of management and can differ from our historical experience, could be material. To the extent that these adjustments result in an increase, a reduction or the elimination of previously reported contract revenue, we would recognize a credit or a charge against current earnings, which could be material. Our inability to deliver our backlog on time could affect our future sales and profitability, and our relationships with our customers. Our backlog was $540.9 million at December 31, 2024 and $370.9 million at December 31, 2023. Our ability to meet customer delivery schedules for our backlog is dependent on a number of factors including, but not limited to, access to the raw materials required for production, an adequately trained and capable workforce, project engineering expertise for certain large projects, sufficient internal manufacturing plant capacity, available subcontractors and appropriate planning and scheduling of manufacturing resources. Our failure to deliver in accordance with customer expectations may result in damage to existing customer relationships and result in the loss of future business. Failure to deliver backlog in accordance with expectations could negatively impact our financial performance and cause adverse changes in the market price of our common stock. Volatility of oil and natural gas prices can adversely affect demand for our products and services. Volatility in oil and natural gas prices can impact our customers’ activity levels and spending for our products and services. Current energy prices are important contributors to cash flow for our customers and their ability to fund capital expenditures. Lower oil and natural gas prices generally lead to decreased spending by our customers. While higher oil and natural gas prices generally lead to increased spending by our customers, sustained high energy prices can be an impediment to economic growth, and can therefore negatively impact spending by our customers. Our customers also take into account the volatility of energy prices and other risk factors by requiring higher returns for individual projects if there is a higher perceived risk. Any of these factors could affect the demand for oil and natural gas and could have a material effect on our results of operations. Increasing costs for manufactured components, raw materials, transportation, health care and energy prices may adversely affect our profitability. We use a broad range of manufactured components and raw materials in our products, including raw steel, steel-related components, resin, filtration media and equipment such as fans and motors. Materials, wages and subcontracting costs comprise the largest components of our total costs, and increases in the price of these items could materially increase our operating costs and materially adversely affect our profit margins. Similarly, transportation, steel and health care costs have risen steadily over the past few years and could represent an increasing burden for us. Although we try to contain these costs whenever possible, and although we try to pass along increased costs in the form of price increases to our customers, we may be unsuccessful in doing so, and even when successful, the timing of such price increases may lag significantly behind our incurrence of higher costs. Our financial performance may vary significantly from period to period. Our annual revenues and earnings have varied in the past and are likely to vary in the future. Our contracts generally stipulate customer-specific delivery terms and may have contract cycles of a year or more, which subjects these contracts to many factors beyond our control. In addition, contracts that are significantly larger in size than our typical contracts tend to intensify their impact on our annual operating results. Furthermore, as a significant portion of our operating costs are fixed, an unanticipated decrease in our revenues, a delay or cancellation of orders in backlog, or a decrease in the demand for our products, may have a significant impact on our annual operating results. Therefore, our annual operating results may be subject to significant variations and our operating performance in one period may not be indicative of our future performance. Customers may cancel or delay projects. As a result, our backlog may not be indicative of our future revenue. Customers may cancel or delay projects for reasons beyond our control. Our orders normally contain cancellation provisions that permit us to recover our costs, and, for most contracts, a portion of our anticipated profit in the event a customer cancels an order. If a customer elects to cancel an order, we may not realize the full amount of revenues included in our backlog. If projects are delayed, the timing of our revenues could be affected and projects may remain in our backlog for extended periods of time. Revenue recognition occurs over long periods of time and is subject to unanticipated delays. If we receive relatively large orders in any given quarter, fluctuations in the levels of our quarterly backlog can result because the backlog in that quarter may reach levels that may not be sustained in subsequent quarters. As a result, our backlog may not be indicative of our future revenues. With rare exceptions, we are not issued contracts until a customer is ready to start work on a project. Thus, it is our experience that the only relationship between the length of a project and the possibility that a project may be cancelled is simply the fact that there is more time involved. For example, in a year-long project as opposed to a three-month project, more time is available for the customer to experience a softening in its business, which may cause the customer to cancel a project. 12 We face significant competition in the markets we serve. All of the product and solution categories in which we compete are highly fragmented and competitive. We compete in industrial markets against a number of local, regional and national manufacturers and suppliers in each of our product or service lines. Our products primarily compete on the basis of performance, quality, reliability, lead time, on-time delivery, and safety supported by advanced engineering and operational excellence. We must also be responsive to any technological developments, including expanded use of data analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, and related changing customer requirements. Any failure by us to compete effectively in the markets we serve could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We may incur material costs as a result of existing or future product liability claims, or other claims and litigation that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows; and our insurance coverage may not cover all claims or may be insufficient to cover the claims. Despite our quality assurance measures, we may be exposed to product liability claims, other claims and litigation in the event that the use of our products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage or our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected. Such claims may also be accompanied by fraud and deceptive trade practices claims. While we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain product liability and other claims, we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against product liability and other claims. Furthermore, our insurance may not cover damages from breach of contract by us or based on alleged fraud or deceptive trade practices. Any future damages that are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, product liability and other claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome. An unsuccessful defense of a product liability or other claim could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Even if we are successful in defending against a claim relating to our products, claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and us. Liability to customers under warranties may adversely affect our reputation, our ability to obtain future business and our results of operations. We provide certain warranties as to the proper operation and conformance to specifications of the products we manufacture or produce. Failure of our products to operate properly or to meet specifications may increase our costs by requiring additional engineering resources and services, replacement of parts and equipment or monetary reimbursement to customers. We have in the past received warranty claims, are currently subject to warranty claims, and we expect to continue to receive warranty claims in the future. To the extent that we incur substantial warranty claims in any period, our reputation, our ability to obtain future business and our results of operations could be adversely affected. Risks Related to our Business Model and Capital Structure Our gross profit may be affected by shifts in our product mix. Certain of our products have higher gross profit margins than others. Consequently, changes in the product mix of our sales from quarter-to-quarter or from year-to-year can have a significant impact on our reported gross profit margins. Certain of our products also have a much higher internally manufactured cost component. Therefore, changes from quarter-to-quarter or from year-to-year can have a significant impact on our reported gross profit margins. In addition, contracts with a higher percentage of subcontracted work or equipment purchases may result in lower gross profit margins. Our manufacturing operations are dependent on third-party suppliers. Although we are not dependent on any one supplier, we are dependent on the ability of our third-party suppliers to supply our raw materials, as well as certain specific component parts and sub-assemblies. The third-party suppliers upon which we depend may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, insolvency, lack of liquidity, adverse economic conditions, operational failure, fraud, loss of key personnel, health-related shutdowns, or other reasons. We cannot ensure that our third-party suppliers will dedicate sufficient resources to meet our scheduled delivery requirements or that our suppliers will have sufficient resources to satisfy our requirements during any period of sustained demand. Failure of suppliers to supply, or delays in supplying, our raw materials or certain components, or allocations in the supply of certain high demand raw components, for any reason, including, without limitation, disruptions in our suppliers’ due to cybersecurity incidents, terrorist activity, public health crises, fires or other natural disasters could 13 materially adversely affect our operations and ability to meet our own delivery schedules on a timely and competitive basis. Additionally, our third-party suppliers may provide us with raw materials or component parts that fail to meet our expectations or the expectations of our customers, which could subject us to product liability claims, other claims and litigation. Our use of subcontractors could potentially harm our profitability and business reputation. Occasionally we act as a prime contractor in some of the projects we undertake. In our capacity as lead provider, and when acting as a prime contractor, we perform a portion of the work on our projects with our own resources and typically subcontract activities such as manufacturing, electrical work, concrete work, insulation, conveyors and controls. In our industry, the lead contractor is normally responsible for the performance of the entire contract, including subcontract work. Thus, when acting as a prime contractor, we are subject to risk associated with the failure of one or more subcontractors to perform as anticipated. We employ subcontractors at various locations around the world to meet our customers’ needs in a timely manner, meet local content requirements and reduce costs. Subcontractors generally perform the majority of our manufacturing for international customers. We also utilize subcontractors in North America. The use of subcontractors decreases our control over the performance of these functions and could result in project delays, escalated costs and substandard quality. These risks could adversely affect our profitability and business reputation. In addition, many of our competitors use the same subcontractors that we use and could potentially influence our ability to hire these subcontractors. If we were to lose relationships with key subcontractors, our business could be adversely impacted. A significant portion of our accounts receivable are related to larger contracts, which increases our exposure to credit risk. Significant portions of our sales are to customers who place large orders for custom products and whose activities are related to the power generation and oil and gas industries. As a result, our exposure to credit risk is affected to some degree by conditions within these industries and governmental and or political conditions. We frequently attempt to reduce our exposure to credit risk by requiring progress or milestone payments and letters of credit as well as closely monitoring the credit worthiness of our customers. However, the continuing economic climate and other unanticipated events that affect our customers could have a materially adverse impact on our operating results. Changes in billing terms can increase our exposure to working capital and credit risk. Our products are generally sold under contracts that allow us to bill upon the completion of certain agreed upon milestones or upon actual shipment of the product, and certain contracts include a retention provision. We attempt to negotiate progress-billing milestones on all large contracts to help us manage the working capital and credit risk associated with these large contracts. Consequently, shifts in the billing terms of the contracts in our backlog from period to period can increase our requirement for working capital and can increase our exposure to credit risk. Currency fluctuations may reduce profits on our foreign sales or increase our costs, either of which could adversely affect our financial results. Given that approximately 33% of our 2024 revenues are outside the United States, we are subject to the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Although our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, a portion of our sales and operating costs are realized in foreign currencies. Our sales and profitability are impacted by the movement of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in the countries in which we generate sales and conduct operations. Long-term fluctuations in relative currency values could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial conditions. If our goodwill or indefinite lived intangibles become impaired, we may be required to recognize charges that would adversely impact our results of operations. As of December 31, 2024, goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles were $279.2 million, or 36.8%, of our total assets. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized, but instead are subject to annual impairment evaluations (or more frequently if circumstances require). Major factors that influence our evaluations are estimates for future revenue and expenses associated with the specific intangible asset or the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides. This is the most sensitive of our estimates related to our evaluations. Other factors considered in our evaluations include assumptions as to the business climate, industry and economic conditions. These assumptions are subjective and different estimates could have a significant impact on the results of our analyses. While management, based on current forecasts and outlooks, believes that the assumptions and estimates are reasonable, we can make no assurances that future actual operating results will be realized as planned and that there will not be material impairment charges as a result. In particular, an economic downturn could have a material adverse impact on our customers thereby forcing them to reduce or curtail doing business with us and such a result may materially affect the amount of cash flow generated by our future operations. Any 14 write-down of goodwill or intangible assets resulting from future periodic evaluations could adversely materially impact our results of operations. We may incur costs as a result of certain restructuring activities, which may negatively impact our financial results, and we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring plans. We are continuously seeking the most cost-effective means and structure to serve our customers, protect our stockholders and respond to changes in our markets. From time to time, we may engage in restructuring activities in an effort to improve cost competitiveness and profitability. We may not achieve the desired or anticipated benefits from these restructuring activities. As a result, restructuring costs may vary significantly from year to year depending on the scope of such activities. Such restructuring costs and expenses could adversely impact our financial results. We are party to asbestos-containing product litigation that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our subsidiary, Met-Pro, along with numerous other third parties, has been named as a defendant in asbestos-related lawsuits filed against a large number of industrial companies including, in particular, those in the pump and fluid handling industries. In management’s opinion, the complaints typically have been vague, general and speculative, alleging that Met-Pro, along with the numerous other defendants, sold unidentified asbestos-containing products and engaged in other related actions that caused injuries (including death) and loss to the plaintiffs. The Company’s insurers have hired attorneys who, together with the Company, are vigorously defending these cases. The Company believes that its insurance coverage is adequate for the cases currently pending against the Company and for the foreseeable future, assuming a continuation of the current volume, nature of cases and settlement amounts. However, the Company has no control over the number and nature of cases that are filed against it, nor as to the financial health of its insurers or their position as to coverage. The Company also presently believes that none of the pending cases will have a material adverse impact upon the Company’s results of operations, liquidity or financial condition. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding the asbestos-related litigation in which we are involved. We have $221.5 million of indebtedness as of December 31, 2024, and incurrence of additional indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, remain in compliance with debt covenants, make payments on our debt and limit our growth. Our outstanding indebtedness could have important consequences for investors, including the following: •it may be more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the agreement governing our Credit Facility (as defined in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K), and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of the agreements governing any additional indebtedness, including financial and other restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under such agreements; •the covenants contained in our debt agreements, including our Credit Facility, limit our ability to borrow money in the future for acquisitions, capital expenditures or to meet our operating expenses or other general corporate obligations; •the amount of our interest expense may increase because a substantial portion of our borrowings is at variable rates of interest, which, if interest rates increase, could result in higher interest expense; •we may need to use a portion of our cash flows to pay interest on our debt, which will reduce the amount of money we have for operations, working capital, capital expenditures, expansion, acquisitions or general corporate or other business activities; •we may have a higher level of debt than some of our competitors, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage; •we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our industry or the economy in general; and •our debt level could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate. Our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors. We cannot be certain that our earnings will be sufficient to allow us to pay the principal and interest on our existing or future debt and meet our other obligations. If we do not have enough money to service our existing or future debt, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing or future debt, sell assets, borrow more money or raise equity. We may not be able to refinance our existing or future debt, sell assets, borrow more money or raise equity on terms acceptable to us, if at all. 15 Our ability to execute our growth strategies may be limited by our ability to secure and retain additional financing on terms reasonably acceptable to us or at all. Certain of our competitors are larger companies that may have greater access to capital, and therefore may have a competitive advantage over us should our access to capital be limited. We might be unable to protect our intellectual property rights and our products could infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which could expose us to costly disputes. Although we believe that our products do not infringe patents or violate the proprietary rights of others, it is possible that our existing patent rights may not be valid or that infringement of existing or future patents or proprietary rights may occur. In the event our products infringe patents or proprietary rights of others, we may be required to modify the design of our products or obtain a license for certain technology. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so in a timely manner, upon acceptable terms and conditions, or at all. Failure to do any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect upon our business. Moreover, if our products infringe patents or proprietary rights of others, we could, under certain circumstances, become liable for damages, which also could have a material adverse effect on our business. Risks related to our pension plan may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow. Significant changes in actual investment return on pension assets, discount rates and other factors may adversely affect our results of operations and pension plan contributions in future periods. GAAP requires that we calculate the income or expense of our plan using actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates. We establish the discount rate used to determine the present value of the projected and accumulated benefit obligation at the end of each year based upon the available market rates for high quality, fixed-income investments. An increase in the discount rate would increase future pension expense and, conversely, a decrease in the discount rate would decrease future pension expense. Funding requirements for our pension plan may become more significant. The ultimate amounts to be contributed are dependent upon, among other things, interest rates, underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations. We may be subject to substantial withdrawal liability assessments in the future related to multiemployer pension plans to which certain of our subsidiaries make contributions pursuant to collective bargaining agreements. Under applicable federal law, any employer contributing to a multiemployer pension plan that completely ceases participating in the plan while the plan is underfunded is subject to payment of such employer’s assessed share of the aggregate unfunded vested benefits of the plan. In certain circumstances, an employer can be assessed a withdrawal liability for a partial withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan. If any of these adverse events were to occur in the future, it could result in a substantial withdrawal liability assessment that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We have made and may make future acquisitions or divestitures, which involve numerous risks that could impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our operating strategy has involved expanding or contracting our scope of products and services through selective acquisitions or divestitures and the formation or elimination of new business units that are then integrated or separated into or out of our family of turnkey system providers. We have acquired other businesses, product or service lines, assets or technologies that are complementary to our business. We may be unable to find or consummate future acquisitions at acceptable prices and terms. We continually evaluate potential acquisition opportunities in the ordinary course of business. Although we conduct what we believe to be a prudent level of investigation regarding the operating and financial condition of the businesses, product or service lines, assets or technologies we purchase, an unavoidable level of risk remains regarding their actual operating and financial condition. Until we actually assume operating control of these businesses, product or service lines, assets or technologies, we may not be able to ascertain their actual value or understand potential liabilities. This is particularly true with respect to acquisitions outside the United States. In addition, acquisitions of businesses may require additional debt or equity financing, resulting in additional leverage or dilution of ownership. Our Credit Facility contains certain covenants that limit, or which may have the effect of limiting, among other things, acquisitions, capital expenditures, the sale of assets and the incurrence of additional indebtedness. Societal responses to climate change could adversely affect our business and performance, including indirectly through impacts on our customers. Concerns over the long-term impacts of climate change have led and will continue to lead to governmental efforts around the world to mitigate those impacts. Consumers and businesses also may change their behavior as a result of these concerns. We and our customers 16 will need to respond to new laws and regulations as well as consumer and business preferences resulting from climate change concerns. We and our customers may face cost increases, asset value reductions and operating process changes. The impact on our customers will likely vary depending on their specific attributes, including reliance on or role in carbon intensive activities. Among the impacts to us could be a drop in demand for our products and services, particularly in oil and gas industries. In addition, we could face reductions in our creditworthiness or in the value of our assets securing loans. Our efforts to take these risks into account in making business decisions, including by increasing our business with climate-friendly companies, may not be effective in protecting us from the negative impact of new laws and regulations or changes in consumer or business behavior. Global climate change and related emphasis on environmental, social and governance (""ESG"") matters by various stakeholders could negatively affect our business. Customer, investor and employee expectations relating to ESG have been rapidly evolving and increasing. In addition, government organizations are enhancing or advancing legal and regulatory requirements specific to ESG matters. The heightened stakeholder focus on ESG issues related to our business requires the continuous monitoring of various and evolving laws, regulations, standards and expectations and the associated reporting requirements. A failure to adequately meet stakeholder expectations may result in noncompliance, the loss of business, reputational impacts, diluted market valuation, an inability to attract customers and an inability to attract and retain top talent. In addition, our adoption of certain standards or mandated compliance to certain requirements could necessitate additional investments that could impact our profitability. Climate changes, such as extreme weather conditions, create financial risk to our business. Global physical climate changes, including unseasonable weather conditions, could result in reduced demand or product obsolescence for certain of our customers’ products and/or price modifications for our customers’ products and the resources needed to produce them. This could in turn put pressure on our manufacturing costs and result in reduced profit margin associated with certain of our customer programs, or loss of customer programs that we may not be able to replace. Risks Related to Human Capital Management The loss of key personnel or inability to attract and retain additional personnel could affect our ability to successfully grow our business. Our future success depends upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel, and on our ability to continue to identify, attract, retain and motivate them. Implementing our business strategy requires specialized engineering and other talent, as our revenues are highly dependent on technological and product innovations. The market for employees in our industry is extremely competitive, and competition for talent, particularly engineering talent, increasingly attempt to hire, and to varying degrees have been successful in hiring, our employees. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees, our business may be harmed. Work stoppages or similar difficulties could significantly disrupt our operations. Approximately 260 of our approximately 1,600 employees are represented by international or independent labor unions under various union contracts, which, for our covered employees in the United States, expire between November 12, 2025 and May 1, 2026. It is possible that our workforce will become more unionized in the future. Although we consider our employee relations to generally be good, our existing labor agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at one or more of our facilities, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. Unionization activities could also increase our costs, which could have an adverse effect on our profitability. Additionally, a work stoppage at one of our suppliers could adversely affect our operations if an alternative source of supply were not readily available. Work stoppages by employees of our customers also could result in reduced demand for our products. Information Technology and Cybersecurity Risks Our dependence on information systems and the failure of such systems, could significantly disrupt our business and negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We are highly dependent on information systems that are increasingly operated by third parties and as a result we have a limited ability to ensure their continued operation. We rely on information technology systems, networks and infrastructure in managing our day-to-day operations. In the event of systems failure or interruption, including those related to force majeure, telecommunications failures, criminal acts, including hardware or software break-ins or extortion attempts, or viruses, or other cybersecurity incidents, we will have limited ability to affect the timing and success of systems restoration and any resulting interruption in our ability to manage 17 and operate our business could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Additionally, our vendors may incorporate artificial intelligence tools into their offerings, which may inhibit their ability to maintain an adequate level of service and experience. Increased information technology cybersecurity threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, and products. Increased global information technology cybersecurity threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime, including utilization of generative artificial intelligence, pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and communications. While we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems, and maintenance of backup and protective systems, our systems, networks and products remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats. Depending on their nature and scope, such threats could potentially lead to the compromise of confidential information and communications, improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations. We have cybersecurity insurance related to a breach event covering expenses for notification, credit monitoring, investigation, crisis management, public relations and legal advice. However, damage and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered or exceed the amount of any insurance available or may result in increased cybersecurity and other insurance premiums. In response to an increased reliance on our information technology systems, we have taken proactive measures to strengthen our information technology systems, including completion of a National Institute of Standards and Technology (""NIST"") assessment, upgraded security patches across all servers, development of best-in-class hack protection service, implementation of recurring company-wide security training and enablement of advanced security for our major information systems. Management provides the Audit Committee with regular cybersecurity program updates including cybersecurity posture, risk management activities, and emerging risk. Furthermore, the Company may have access to sensitive, confidential, or personal data or information that may be subject to privacy and security laws, regulations, or other contractually-imposed controls. Despite our use of reasonable and appropriate controls, material security breaches, theft, misplaced, lost or corrupted data, programming, or employee errors and/or malfeasance could lead to the compromise or improper use of such sensitive, confidential, or personal data or information, resulting in possible negative consequences, such as fines, ransom demands, penalties, loss of reputation, competitiveness or customers, or other negative consequences resulting in adverse impacts to our results of operations or financial condition. Regulatory Compliance and International Operations Risks Disruptions in the political, regulatory, economic and social conditions of the countries in which we conduct business could negatively impact our business, financial condition and profits. We operate and do business in many countries in addition to the United States. For the year ended December 31, 2024, approximately 33% of our total revenue was derived from products or services ultimately delivered or provided to end users outside the United States. As part of our operating strategy, we intend to expand our international operations through internal growth and selected acquisitions. Operations outside of the United States, particularly in emerging markets, are subject to a variety of risks that are different from or are in addition to the risks we face within the United States. Among others, these risks include: (i) local, economic, political and social conditions, including potential hyperinflationary conditions and political instability in certain countries; (ii) tax-related risks, including the imposition of taxes and the lack of beneficial treaties, that result in a higher effective tax rate for us; (iii) imposition of limitations on the remittance of dividends and payments by foreign subsidiaries; (iv) difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign local systems; (v) domestic and foreign customs, tariffs and quotas or other trade barriers; (vi) risk of nationalization of private enterprises by foreign governments; (vii) managing and obtaining support and distribution channels for overseas operations; (viii) hiring and retaining qualified management personnel for our overseas operations; and (ix) the results of new trade agreements and changes in membership to international coalitions or unions. We are also exposed to risks relating to U.S. policy with respect to companies doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, in particular increased trade restrictions, tariffs or taxes on import from countries where we procure or manufacture products, such as China, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. For instance, the U.S. and Chinese governments have imposed a series of significant incremental retaliatory tariffs to certain imported goods. Given the uncertainty regarding the duration of the imposed tariffs, as well as the potential for additional tariffs by the U.S., China or other countries, as well as other changes in tax policy, trade regulations or trade agreements, and the Company’s ability to implement strategies to mitigate the impact of changes in tax policy, tariffs or other trade regulations, our exposure to the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, compliance with foreign and domestic legal and regulatory requirements, including import, export, defense regulations and foreign exchange controls and anti-corruption laws, as discussed below, such as the FCPA (as defined below), the U.K. Bribery 18 Act (as defined below), the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulations and similar laws of other jurisdictions, could adversely impact our ability to compete against companies in such jurisdictions. Moreover, the violation of such laws or regulations, by us or our representatives, could result in severe penalties including monetary fines, criminal proceedings and suspension of export privileges. The occurrence of one or more of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our international operations or upon our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws worldwide. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (""FCPA""), the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 (""U.K. Bribery Act""), and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstanc",49919,rf,20250225,2025,10K,real_textdata_2025

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Management’s discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which include additional information about our accounting policies, practices and the transactions underlying our financial results. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes including various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, taxes, environmental and other matters arising during the normal course of business. We apply our best judgment, our knowledge of existing facts and circumstances and actions that we may undertake in the future in determining the estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience, as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances, such as current economic conditions, and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results may differ from these estimates. Overview Business Overview CECO is a leading environmentally focused, diversified industrial company, serving the broad landscape of industrial air, industrial water and energy transition markets globally by providing innovative technology and application expertise. We help companies grow their business with safe, clean, and more efficient solutions that help protect people, the environment and industrial equipment. Our solutions improve air and water quality, optimize emissions management, and increase the energy and process efficiency for highly engineered applications in power generation, midstream and downstream hydrocarbon processing and transport, chemical processing, electric vehicle production, polysilicon fabrication, semiconductor and electronics production, battery production and recycling, specialty metals, aluminum and steel production, beverage can manufacturing, and industrial and produced water and wastewater treatment, and a wide range of other industrial end markets. In 2024 and the first quarter of 2025, we disclosed multiple transactions that strategically align with the Company’s portfolio management strategy and vision. These transactions include the acquisition of Profire Energy (""Profire"") and the intended divestiture of the Company’s Fluid Handling business. Profire, a former publicly traded company on the NASDAQ under ticker symbol PFIE, is a leading North American supplier of mission-critical combustion automation and control solution services. Their core offering supports emissions reduction, safety objectives, and industry regulations. Profire has a large install base across oil & gas, petrochemical, and natural gas markets, with growing exposure to other energy transition markets. The business is headquartered in Lindon, Utah, with a research and development center in Edmonton-Alberta, Canada. The business has a long-tenured and experienced leadership team and had 2024 revenues of $63 million with accretive EBITDA margins. Fluid Handling is a well-positioned business with strong brands in the pumps and filters space. However, we are focused on businesses that more closely align with our strategic investments and leadership positions in the air, water and energy transition spaces. Industry Trends and Corporate Strategy We are a global corporation with worldwide operations. As a global business, our operations are affected by worldwide, regional and industry-specific economic factors, wherever we operate or do business. Our geographic and industry diversity, and the breadth of our product and services portfolio, have helped mitigate the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on our consolidated operating results. We believe growth for our products and services is driven by the increase in demand for air quality and water treatment solutions, the energy transition, a shift towards cleaner sources of fuel such as natural gas, hydrogen, nuclear, and renewable sources, and increased awareness of our customers about corporate social responsibility and interest to procure equipment and solutions that protects employees, the environment and their industrial equipment. With a shift to cleaner, more environmentally responsible power generation, power providers and industrial power consumers are building new facilities that use cleaner fuels. In developed markets, natural gas is the largest source of electricity generation. We supply product offerings throughout the entire natural gas value chain and believe expansion will drive growth within our Engineered Systems segment for our gas separation & filtration, pressure products, acoustical equipment , water treatment solutions and DeNOx SCR systems for natural-gas-fired power plants. Increases in global natural gas, installed miles of new pipeline, including future CO2 and hydrogen pipelines, and liquified natural gas (""LNG"") demand and supply all stand to drive the need for our products. We also believe there is a growing demand to control and reduce air and water emissions from industrial facilities for which our pollution control equipment will serve. In 2021, the US Congress passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act with $550 billion 26 of new federal spending aimed at rebuilding roads and bridges, climate resilience, and other environmental initiatives. Similar investments are being made in many other countries in which we do business. As industrial capital expenditures grow, corporations are seeking to do so with a smaller environmental impact. These regulatory and economic tailwinds coupled with shareholder pressure on companies to improve their sustainability and reduce their global carbon footprint serve as catalysts for a growing set of opportunities for our portfolio of equipment and solutions. We continue to focus on increasing revenues and profitability in developing markets, where environmental awareness and associated regulatory standards are increasing, while continuing to strengthen and expand our product offerings and channels in our domestic market of the United States. Our enterprise strategy consists of a combined operational strategy and capital allocation strategy. Our operational strategy is implemented through our technology and application-based platforms aligned around target customers and end markets where our solutions are particularly valuable. Core elements of our operational strategy are commercial and operational excellence, margin expansion, recurring revenue growth, cash flow generation, product management, and project management execution. Our capital allocation strategy supports the growth and value creation generated by our operational strategy. We will focus our capital deployment on building out our leading industrial air solutions portfolio, advancing our emerging industrial water treatment position, and supporting our customers as they make the transition to cleaner more sustainable forms of energy, while also shifting our portfolio mix towards businesses with more recurring revenue and more predictable cash flows, strong secular growth trends and less cyclicality. While the primary focuses of our capital allocation strategy is organic growth and portfolio management, the Company closely monitors its leverage and debt repayment strategies. Market Pressures The senior management team monitors and manages the Company’s ability to operate effectively as the result of market pressures. In particular, we are currently experiencing shortages of raw materials and inflationary pressures for certain materials and labor. We have secured raw materials from existing and alternate suppliers and have taken other mitigating actions to mitigate supply disruptions; however, we cannot guarantee that we can continue to do so in the future. In this event, our business, results and financial condition could be adversely affected. Operations Overview Our segments consist of like end-market and end-market adjacent platforms. Our platforms are structured to win in their target markets with a core focus on understanding customer needs and providing best-in-class solutions. Our business model provides scalable efficiencies enabling us to serve our customers with a variety of products that we typically classify into three categories: make-to-order, configure-to-order, and engineer-to-order. For our project-based platforms, we leverage third-party subcontract fabrication partners in a global network to execute for our customers world-wide. Our platforms are focused on sales, application engineering, product management, project management, and supply chain execution for our customers. Our operations management team has distinct industry expertise coupled with strong leadership skills resulting in a customer-first mindset across the business. Our operations management team works closely with our Chief Executive Officer on global fulfillment strategies, operational excellence, resource allocation, and employee development. Within our segments we have monthly business reviews to ensure we are serving customers, achieving our operating plan, and executing on strategic growth initiatives. These reviews include, but are not limited to pipeline reviews, quotation reviews, project management reviews, financial performance, manufacturing scorecards, safety, and customer feedback. In these reviews we focus on metrics such as quality, customer satisfaction, on-time-delivery, lead-times, price, inflation, project margins, backlog, and above all, safety. In support of the segments, centralized teams provide back-office functions for scale, efficiency, and compliance. These key functions include: accounting, treasury, tax, payroll, human resources and total rewards management, legal, information technology, marketing, and internal control over financial reporting. We have excellent collaboration between our platforms and our centralized service teams ensuring optimal efficiency and alignment on growth and improvement initiatives. 27 Our reportable segments are: •Engineered Systems segment: Our Engineered Systems segment serves the power generation, hydrocarbon processing, water/wastewater treatment, oily water separation and treatment, marine and naval vessels, and midstream oil and gas sectors. We seek to address the global demand for environmental and equipment protection solutions with our highly engineered platforms including emissions management, fluid bed cyclones, thermal acoustics, separation and filtration, and dampers and expansion joints. •Industrial Process Solutions segment: Our Industrial Process Solutions segment serves the broad industrial sector with solutions for air pollution and contamination control, fluid handling, and process filtration in applications such as aluminum beverage can production, automobile production, food and beverage processing, semiconductor fabrication, electronics production, steel and aluminum mill processing, wood manufacturing, desalination, and aquaculture markets. We assist customers in maintaining clean and safe operations for employees, reducing energy consumption, minimizing waste for customers, and meeting regulatory standards for toxic emissions, fumes, volatile organic compounds, and odor elimination through our platforms including duct fabrication and installation, industrial air, and fluid handling. Our contracts are obtained either through customer upselling based on our leading brands and significant install base, competitive bidding or as a result of negotiations with our customers. Contract terms offered by us are generally dependent on the complexity and risk of the project as well as the resources that will be required to complete the project. Our focus is on increasing our operating margins as well as our gross margin percentage, which translates into stronger operating results. Our cost of sales is principally driven by a number of factors, including material and subcontract prices and labor cost and availability. Changes in these factors may have a material impact on our overall gross profit margins. We break down costs of sales into five categories, as follows: •Subcontracts—Electrical work, concrete work, subcomponents and other subcontracts necessary to produce our products; •Labor—Our direct labor both in the shop and in the field; •Material—Raw materials that we buy to build our products, fans, motors, control panels and other equipment necessary for turnkey systems; and •Factory overhead—Costs of facilities and supervision wages necessary to produce our products. In general, subcontracts are the highest percentage of costs and also the most flexible followed by labor, material, and equipment. Due to the project nature and global orientation of several of our platforms, leveraging subcontract fabrication partners close to our customers increases our ability to meet customer delivery expectations at market competitive pricing. In periods where orders are infrequent, we do not have to maintain the fixed cost of a manufacturing plant. Across our various product lines, the relative relationships of these cost categories change and cause variations in gross margin percentage. Material and labor costs can increase quickly, which also reduces gross margin percentage. As material cost inflation occurs, the Company seeks to pass this cost onto our customers as price increases. Selling and administrative expense principally includes sales and engineering payroll and related fringes, advertising and marketing expenditures as well as all corporate and administrative functions and other costs that support our operations. Variable compensation based on the Company’s performance is included in selling and administrative expense. An advantage of our operating model is that as revenue grows, we have significant operating leverage on our fixed selling and administrative cost structure. Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). These GAAP financial statements include certain charges the Company believes are not indicative of its core ongoing operational performance. As a result, the Company provides financial information in this MD&A that was not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to the information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company provides this supplemental non-GAAP financial information, because the Company’s management utilizes it to evaluate its ongoing financial performance and the Company believes it provides greater transparency to investors as supplemental information to its GAAP results. 28 The Company has provided the non-GAAP financial measures including non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP net income as a result of the adjustment for items that the Company believes are not indicative of its ongoing operations. These items include charges associated with the Company’s acquisitions, and the items described below in “Consolidated Results.” The Company believes that evaluation of its financial performance compared with prior and future periods can be enhanced by a presentation of results that exclude the impact of these items. The Company has incurred substantial expense and generated substantial income associated with acquisitions. While the Company cannot predict the exact timing or amounts of such charges, it does expect to treat these charges as special items in its future presentation of non-GAAP results. Results of Operations Consolidated Results Our consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 are as follows: Year ended December 31, (dollars in millions) 2024 2023 2022 Net sales $ 557.9 $ 544.8 $ 422.6 Cost of goods sold 361.8 373.8 294.4 Gross profit $ 196.1 $ 171.0 $ 128.2 Percent of sales 35.1 % 31.4 % 30.3 % Selling and administrative expenses $ 146.7 $ 122.9 $ 93.4 Percent of sales 26.3 % 22.6 % 22.1 % Amortization and earnout expenses 9.1 8.2 6.8 Acquisition and integration expenses 4.2 2.5 4.5 Restructuring expenses 0.5 1.3 0.1 Asbestos litigation expenses 0.2 — — Executive transition expenses — 1.5 1.2 Operating income $ 35.4 $ 34.6 $ 22.2 Percent of sales 6.3 % 6.4 % 5.3 % Other (expense) income, net $ (4.7 ) $ 0.4 $ 6.9 Interest expense (13.0 ) (13.4 ) (5.4 ) Income before income taxes $ 17.7 $ 21.5 $ 23.7 Income tax expense 3.3 7.0 5.4 Net income $ 14.4 $ 14.5 $ 18.3 Noncontrolling interest (1.5 ) (1.6 ) (0.8 ) Net income attributable to CECO Environmental Corp. $ 13.0 $ 12.9 $ 17.4 29 Non-GAAP Measures To compare operating performance between the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 the Company has adjusted GAAP operating income to exclude (1) amortization of intangible assets, and earnout expenses, (2) restructuring expenses primarily relating to severance, facility exits, and associated legal expenses, (3) acquisition and integration expenses, which include legal, accounting, and other expenses, (4) executive transition expenses, including severance for the Company's former executives, fees and expenses incurred in the search, for and hiring, of new executives and (5) asbestos litigation expenses related to expected future settlement payments. See “Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” above. The following tables present the reconciliation of GAAP operating income and GAAP operating margin to non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin, and GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income. Year Ended December 31, (dollars in millions) 2024 2023 2022 Operating income as reported in accordance with GAAP $ 35.4 $ 34.6 $ 22.2 Operating margin in accordance with GAAP 6.3 % 6.4 % 5.3 % Amortization and earnout expenses 9.1 8.2 6.8 Acquisition and integration expenses 4.2 2.5 4.5 Restructuring expenses 0.5 1.3 0.1 Asbestos litigation expenses 0.2 — — Executive transition expenses — 1.5 1.2 Non-GAAP operating income $ 49.4 $ 48.1 $ 34.8 Non-GAAP operating margin 8.9 % 8.8 % 8.2 % Year Ended December 31, (dollars in millions) 2024 2023 2022 Net income as reported in accordance with GAAP $ 13.0 $ 12.9 $ 17.4 Amortization and earnout expenses 9.1 8.2 6.8 Acquisition and integration expenses 4.2 2.5 4.5 Restructuring expenses 0.5 1.3 0.1 Asbestos litigation expenses 0.2 — — Executive transition expenses — 1.5 1.2 Foreign currency remeasurement 4.3 (1.0 ) (1.3 ) Tax (benefit) expense of adjustments (4.6 ) 1.2 (2.8 ) Non-GAAP net income $ 26.7 $ 26.6 $ 25.9 Non-GAAP net income as a percentage of sales 4.8 % 4.9 % 6.1 % 30 Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 Consolidated net sales in 2024 were $557.9 million compared with $544.8 million in 2023, an increase of $13.1 million or 2.4%. The increase was driven by brands within the industrial processing solutions segment, notably in industrial air, ducting, and ventilation applications. Specific end markets driving the increase include building materials, metals, and automotive. Approximately $33.1 million of net sales is attributable to acquisitions that occurred during the preceding twelve-month period. Gross profit increased by $25.1 million, or 14.7%, to $196.1 million in 2024 compared with $171.0 million in 2023. The increase in gross profit was attributable to the increase in sales volume as described above, as well as sales mix, project execution and flow through from higher booked margins, as well as continued benefits from sourcing and value engineering. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 35.1% in 2024 compared with 31.4% in 2023. Orders booked were $667.3 million in 2024 compared with $582.8 million in 2023, an increase of $84.5 million, or 14.5%. Of this $84.5 million increase, $51.5 million represents organic growth, while $33.0 million of orders were attributable to acquisitions that occurred during the preceding twelve-month period. The increase was driven by increased market demand for power. The Company’s current pipeline includes over $4.0 billion worth of project opportunities. Selling and administrative expenses were $146.7 million in 2024 compared with $122.9 million in 2023, an increase of $23.8 million, or 19.4%. The increase is primarily attributed to workforce merit and other annual compensation adjustments, and investments in functional support for sourcing and manufacturing benefits. Amortization and earnout expenses were $9.1 million in 2024 and $8.2 million in 2023, an increase of $0.9 million, or 11.0%. The increase in expense is attributable to an increase of $1.2 million in definite lived asset amortization due to recent acquisitions, partially offset by $0.4 million in earnout expense. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on earnout expenses. Acquisitions and integration expenses related to various merger and acquisition diligence activities, which include legal, accounting and banking expenses, were $4.2 million in 2024, as compared with $2.5 million in 2023, an increase of $1.7 million, or 68.0%. The increase is due to the timing and volume of acquisition activity. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on recent acquisitions. Executive transition expenses were zero in 2024 compared to $1.5 million in 2023, a decrease of $1.5 million. These expenses related to severance for the former executives, as well as fees and other expenses incurred in the search for and hiring of a new executive, specifically as it relates to the departure of the former Chief Operating Officer and transition of the role of Chief Accounting Officer. Restructuring expenses were $0.5 million in 2024 compared to $1.4 million in 2023, a decrease of $0.8 million, or 61.5%. These expenses related to severance, facility exits, and associated legal expenses, primarily as it relates to the exit of certain operations in China. Asbestos litigation expenses were $0.2 million in 2024 compared to zero in 2023, an increase of $0.2 million. These expenses related to expected future settlement payments. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Operating income for 2024 was $35.4 million, an increase of $0.8 million from $34.6 million in 2023. Operating income as a percentage of sales for 2024 was 6.3% compared with 6.4% for 2023. The increase in operating income is primarily attributable to the increase in gross profit. Non-GAAP operating income was $49.4 million in 2024, an increase of $1.3 million from $48.1 million in 2023. The increase in non-GAAP operating income is primarily attributable to the increase in gross profit. Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of sales was 8.9% for 2024 compared with 8.8% for 2023. Other expense for 2024 was $(4.7) million compared to other income of $0.4 million in 2023, a decrease of $5.1 million. The decrease in other (expense) income was primarily attributable to net foreign currency transaction losses in the current year based on changes in exchange rates at our foreign subsidiaries. Interest expense was $13.0 million in 2024 compared to $13.4 million in 2023, a decrease of $0.4 million, or 3.0%. The decrease in interest expense is primarily due to lower a weighted average stated interest rate. 31 Income tax expense was $3.3 million in 2024 compared to $7.0 million in 2023, a decrease of $3.7 million, or 52.9%. The effective tax rate for 2024 was 18.5% compared with 32.6% in 2023. Income tax expense and the effective tax rate for 2024 were affected by changes in valuation allowances, and the net impact of global intangible low-taxed income (""GILTI"") and foreign-derived intangible income (""FDII""), as well as certain permanent differences including state income taxes, non-deductible incentive stock-based compensation, and differences in tax rates among the jurisdictions in which we operate. Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 See the Management Discussion and Analysis section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a discussion of our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. Business Segments The Company’s operations are organized and reviewed by management along its product lines and end markets that the segment serves and are presented in two reportable segments. The results of the segments are reviewed through the “Income from operations” line on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The amounts presented in the Net Sales table below and in the following comments regarding our net sales at the reportable business segment level exclude both intra-segment and inter-segment net sales. The Income from Operations table and corresponding comments regarding operating income at the reportable segment level include both intra-segment and inter-segment operating income. 2024 2023 2022 Net Sales (less intra-, inter-segment sales) (table only in thousands) Engineered Systems Segment $ 384,025 $ 380,108 $ 263,224 Industrial Process Solutions Segment 173,908 164,737 159,403 Total net sales $ 557,933 $ 544,845 $ 422,627 2024 2023 2022 Income from Operations (less intra-, inter-segment profit) (table only in thousands) Engineered Systems segment $ 72,373 $ 59,846 $ 36,200 Industrial Process Solutions segment 29,575 21,630 22,705 Corporate and Other (1) (66,545 ) (46,907 ) (36,744 ) Total income from operations $ 35,403 $ 34,569 $ 22,161 (1)Includes corporate compensation, professional services, information technology, and other general, administrative corporate expenses. This figure excludes earnout expenses / income, which are recorded in the segment in which the expense / income occurs. Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 Engineered Systems segment Our Engineered Systems segment orders booked increased $109.8 million, or 28.1%, to $500.9 million in 2024 compared with $391.1 million in 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to increased demand for energy transition projects and products as the market for power increases. Approximately $28.2 million of orders in 2024 are attributable to acquisitions that occurred during the preceding twelve-month period. Our Engineered Systems segment net sales increased $3.9 million to $384.0 million in 2024 compared with $380.1 million in 2023, an increase of 1.0%. The nominal increase in revenue year-over-year was primarily a result of specific, material project delays, primarily occurring in the second half of 2024 resulting in the absence of substantial revenue recognition in the period. The increase is driven by increases of $9.4 million in our dampers and expansion businesses and $7.2 million in our industrial air businesses, partially offset by a decrease of $9.5 million in our water and wastewater treatment technologies. Approximately $20.1 million of net sales in 2024 is attributable to acquisitions that occurred during the preceding twelve-month period. 32 Operating income for the Engineered Systems segment increased $12.6 million to $72.4 million in 2024 compared with $59.8 million in 2023, an increase of 21.1%. The increase in operating income in primarily attributable to higher gross profit driven by improved sales mix, productivity, project execution, and cost savings initiatives. Industrial Process Solutions segment Our Industrial Process Solutions segment orders booked decreased $25.4 million, or 13.2%, to $166.3 million in 2024 compared with $191.7 million in 2023. The decrease is primarily related to two unique industrial air bookings from 2023 that were not expected to repeat. Approximately $7.9 million of orders in 2024 are attributable to acquisitions that occurred during the preceding twelve month period. Our Industrial Process Solutions segment net sales increased $9.2 million to $173.9 million in 2024 compared with $164.7 million in 2023, an increase of 5.6%. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase of $7.6 million in our duct fabrication and installation businesses. Approximately $13.0 million of net sales in 2024 is attributable to acquisitions that have occurred during the preceding twelve-month period. Operating income for the Industrial Process segment increased $8.0 million to $29.6 million in 2024 compared with $21.6 million in 2023. The increase in operating income in primarily attributable to higher gross profit related to increased sales and project execution. Corporate and Other segment Operating expense for the Corporate and Other segment increased $19.6 million to $66.5 million for 2024 compared with $46.9 million for 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to investments made to support growth inclusive of acquisition and integration expenses, and inflationary increases for wages and services. Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 See the Management Discussion and Analysis section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a discussion of business segment results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. Liquidity and Capital Resources When we undertake large jobs, our working capital objective is to make these projects self-funding. We work to achieve this by obtaining initial down payments, progress billing contracts, when possible, utilizing extended payment terms from material suppliers, and paying sub-contractors after payment from our customers, which is an industry practice. Our investment in net working capital is funded by cash flow from operations and by our revolving line of credit. At December 31, 2024, the Company had working capital of $86.3 million, compared with $78.3 million at December 31, 2023. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 1.35 to 1.00 at December 31, 2024 as compared with a ratio of 1.39 to 1.00 at December 31, 2023. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, cash and cash equivalents totaled $37.8 million and $54.8 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, $29.7 million and $38.5 million, respectively, of our cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries, as well as being denominated in foreign currencies. 33 Debt consisted of the following: December 31, (table only in thousands) 2024 2023 Outstanding borrowings under Credit Facility – Term loan $ — $ 112,424 – Revolving Credit Loan 214,200 17,300 Total outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility 214,200 129,724 Outstanding borrowings under the joint venture term debt 7,297 8,855 Unamortized debt discount (2,617 ) (1,296 ) Total outstanding borrowings 218,880 137,283 Less: current portion (1,650 ) (10,488 ) Total debt, less current portion $ 217,230 $ 126,795 In 2024, the Company made repayments of $112.4 million on the term loan and $1.6 million on the joint venture term debt, with net borrowings of $196.9 million on the revolving credit line. Credit Facility The Company's outstanding borrowings in the United States consist of a senior secured term loan and a senior secured revolver loan with sub-facilities for letters of credit, swing-line loans and multi-currency loans (collectively, the ""Credit Facility""). On October 30, 2023, the Company entered into Amendment No. 4 to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Pursuant to this amendment, the lenders provided an additional term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $75.0 million. On October 7, 2024, the Company entered into the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. This agreement provides for a senior secured revolving credit facility in an initial aggregate principal amount of up to $400.0 million. Under the terms of the Credit Facility, the Company is required to maintain certain financial covenants, including the maintenance of a Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio not greater than 4.00 to 1.00 and a Consolidated Secured Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility) not greater than 3.00 to 1.00. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company was in compliance with all related financial and other restrictive covenants under the Credit Facility. Joint Venture Debt On March 7, 2022, the Company's Effox-Flextor-Mader, Inc. joint venture (""EFM JV"") entered into a loan agreement secured by the assets of the EFM JV in the aggregate principal amount of $11.0 million for the acquisition of General Rubber, LLC. Foreign Debt In addition, the Company has a number of bank guarantee facilities and bilateral lines of credit in various foreign countries currently supported by cash, letters of credit or pledged assets and collateral under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility allows letters of credit and bank guarantee issuances of up to $65.0 million from the bilateral lines of credit secured by pledged assets and collateral under the Credit Facility. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Company’s debt facilities. 34 Total unused credit availability under our Credit Facility and other non-U.S. credit facilities and agreements, exclusive of any potential asset base limitations, is as follows: December 31, 2024 2023 (dollars in millions) Credit Facility, revolving loans $ 400.0 $ 140.0 Draw down (214.2 ) (17.3 ) Letters of credit open (18.9 ) (13.3 ) Total unused credit availability $ 166.9 $ 109.4 Amount available based on borrowing limitations $ 1.0 $ 99.8 Overview of Cash Flows and Liquidity For the year ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 2022 Total operating cash flow provided by operating activities $ 24,828 $ 44,647 $ 29,649 Net cash used in investing activities (105,312 ) (56,486 ) (48,257 ) Net cash provided by financing activities 65,910 21,144 38,176 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (2,673 ) (442 ) (4,978 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ (17,247 ) $ 8,863 $ 14,590 Operating Activities In 2024, $24.8 million of cash was provided by operating activities compared with $44.6 million provided by operating activities in 2023, a decrease of $19.8 million. Cash flow from operating activities in 2024 had an unfavorable impact year-over-year primarily due to changes in net working capital. In 2023, $44.6 million of cash was provided by operating activities compared with $29.6 million provided by operating activities in 2022, an increase of $15.0 million. Cash flow from operating activities in 2023 had a favorable impact year-over-year primarily due to changes in net working capital. Investing Activities In 2024, $105.3 million of cash was used in investing activities, which consisted of $87.9 million for current year acquisitions and $17.4 million for acquisition of property and equipment. In 2023, $56.5 million of cash was used in investing activities, which consisted of $48.1 million for current year acquisitions and $8.4 million for acquisition of property and equipment. Financing Activities Financing activities in 2024 provided cash of $65.9 million, which consisted primarily of $82.9 million of net borrowings under the Credit Facility, used to finance current year acquisitions. This was partially offset by $5.0 million for the repurchase and retirement of our common stock, $2.2 million relating to equity compensation, inclusive of awards surrendered for tax liabilities, proceeds from employee stock purchase plan and exercise of stock options, $2.1 million in distributions to non-controlling interest, $2.1 million of deferred consideration for acquisitions, $1.9 million of financing fees, $2.8 million of earnout payments, and $0.9 million in payments on our capital leases. Financing activities in 2023 provided cash of $21.1 million, which consisted primarily of $27.1 million of net borrowings under the Credit Facility, used to finance current year acquisitions, as well as $1.4 million of proceeds from employee stock purchase plan and exercise of stock options. This was partially offset by $2.1 million of earnout payments, $1.7 million in distributions to non-controlling interest, $1.2 million of deferred consideration for acquisitions, $0.9 million in payments on our capital leases, and $0.4 million of financing fees. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations and borrowing availability under the Credit Facility. We believe that cash flows from operating activities, together with our existing cash and borrowings available under our Credit Facility, will be sufficient for at least the next twelve months to fund our current anticipated uses of cash. After that, our ability to fund these expected uses of cash and to comply with the financial covenants under our debt agreements will depend on the results of future operations, 35 performance and cash flow. Our ability to fund these expected uses from the results of future operations will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business, regulatory, legislative and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our material cash requirements included (i) debt repayments under with respect to our Credit Facility and joint venture term debt, (ii) interest expense, (iii) purchase obligations for costs associated with uncompleted sales contracts, (iv) operating and capital lease obligations and (v) contingent liabilities related to acquisitions, including earnout liabilities and retention payments. We are party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties, and such commitments require a material amount of cash. The following table summarizes the Company’s material cash requirements from known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2024: Payments Due by Period (dollars in thousands) Total Less than 1year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than5 years Term Loan Debt, including joint venture debt $ 7,297 $ 1,650 $ 5,647 $ — $ — Revolving Credit Loan 214,200 — — 214,200 — Interest expense (estimated) 73,532 15,735 46,213 11,584 — Purchase obligations (1) 173,681 173,681 — — — Operating lease obligations 31,161 5,810 8,912 6,730 9,709 Capital lease obligations 5,484 943 1,944 2,022 575 Liabilities related to acquisitions (2) 5,835 60 5,775 — — Totals $ 511,190 $ 197,879 $ 68,491 $ 234,536 $ 10,284 (1)Primarily consists of purchase obligations for costs associated with uncompleted sales contracts. (2)Includes notes payable and expected earnout liability. Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP. Preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related contingent liabilities. Critical accounting estimates or assumptions are those where the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material given the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for uncertain matters, and the potential impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. We consider the estimates discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from fixed-price contracts. We account for a contract after it has been approved by all parties to the arrangement, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. We recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied. A significant amount of our revenue is recognized over a period of time as we perform under the contract because control of the work in process transfers continuously to the customer. For performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. Progress is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs to complete the performance obligation. For these contracts, the cost-to-cost measure best depicts the continuous transfer of goods or services to the customer. The judgments and estimates involved include management’s ability to accurately estimate the contracts’ progress to completion at each financial reporting period. In addition, certain contracts are highly dependent on the work of contractors and other subcontractors participating in a project, over which we have no or limited control, and their performance on such project could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our contracts. Delays resulting from these contractors and subcontractors, changes in the scope of the project, weather, and labor availability also can have an effect on a contract’s profitability. Changes to job performance, job conditions, and estimated profitability may result in revisions to contract revenue and costs and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are made. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. No provision for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts was needed at December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. 36 Inventories The Company’s inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in, first-out inventory costing method. Inventory quantities are regularly reviewed and provisions for excess or obsolete inventory are recorded primarily based on our forecast of future demand and market conditions. Significant unanticipated changes to our forecasts could require a change in the provision for excess or obsolete inventory. Long-lived assets We complete an impairment assessment of the Company's indefinite life intangible assets on an annual basis, during the fourth quarter, or more often as circumstances require. As a part of the annual assessment, we first qualitatively assess whether current events or changes in circumstances lead to a determination that it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of an asset is less than its carrying amount. If there is a qualitative determination that the fair value of a particular asset is more likely than not greater than its carrying value, we do not need to proceed to the quantitative estimated fair value test for that asset. If this qualitative assessment indicates a more likely than not potential that the asset may be impaired, the estimated fair value is calculated using the relief from royalty method. If the estimated fair value of an asset is less than its carrying value, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. During 2024, 2023, and 2022, our annual impairment test indicated no impairment of our indefinite-lived tradenames. Accordingly, we recognized no impairment charges in our financial results for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. For additional information on impairment testing results, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, we review the remaining useful lives of assets to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of depreciation or amortization. If the estimate of a long-lived asset’s remaining useful life is changed, the remaining carrying amount of the asset is depreciated/amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life. Goodwill We complete an impairment assessment of the Company's indefinite life intangible assets on an annual basis, during the fourth quarter, or more often as circumstances require. As a part of the annual assessment, we first qualitatively assess whether current events or changes in circumstances lead to a determination that it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of an asset is less than its carrying amount. If there is a qualitative determination that the fair value of a particular asset is more likely than not greater than its carrying value, we do not need to proceed to the quantitative estimated fair value test for that asset. If this qualitative assessment indicates a more likely than not potential that the asset may be impaired, the estimated fair value is calculated using a weighting of the income method and the market method. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment charge is recorded. During 2024, 2023, and 2022, our annual impairment test indicated no impairment of goodwill. Accordingly, we recognized no impairment charges in our financial results for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. For additional information on impairment testing results, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes Income taxes are determined using the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 740, “Income Taxes”. Income tax expense includes federal, state and foreign income taxes. Deferred income taxes are provided using the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. Tax credits and other incentives reduce income tax expense in the year the credits are claimed. Management must assess the need to accrue or disclose uncertain tax positions for proposed potential adjustments from various federal, state and foreign tax authorities who regularly audit the Company in the normal course of business. In making these assessments, management must often analyze complex tax laws of multiple jurisdictions, including many foreign jurisdictions. The accounting guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and 37 measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We record the related interest expense and penalties, if any, as tax expense in the tax provision. Management must assess the realizability of the Company’s deferred tax assets. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities (including the impact of available carryback and carry forward periods), projected future taxable income, and tax-planning strategies in making this assessment. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforwar",48229,mgmt,20250225,2025,10K,real_textdata_2025
REAL_1075_01_rf_2025_0030,1075,01,1075:01,"Item 1A.Risk Factors33 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSIn addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in the description of these operations contained elsewhere in this report, set forth below are risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results. Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, the following risks and uncertainties apply to Pinnacle West and its subsidiaries, including APS. REGULATORY RISKSOur financial condition depends upon APS’s ability to recover costs in a timely manner from customers through regulated rates and otherwise execute its business strategy.APS is subject to comprehensive regulation by several federal, state and local regulatory agencies that significantly influence its business, liquidity and results of operations and its ability to fully recover costs from utility customers in a timely manner. The ACC regulates APS’s retail electric rates and FERC regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services. The profitability of APS is affected by the rates it may charge and the timeliness of recovering costs incurred through its rates and adjustor recovery mechanisms. Consequently, our financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon the satisfactory resolution of any APS rate proceedings, adjustor recovery and ancillary matters which may come before the ACC and FERC, including in some cases how court challenges to these regulatory decisions are resolved. Arizona, like certain other states, has a statute that allows the ACC to reopen prior decisions and modify otherwise final orders under certain circumstances. Additionally, given that APS is subject to oversight by several regulatory agencies, a resolution by one may not foreclose potential actions by others for similar or related matters. See Note 10.The ACC must also approve APS’s issuance of equity and debt securities, and any significant transfer or encumbrance of APS property used to provide retail electric service and must approve or receive prior notification of certain transactions between us, APS, and our respective affiliates, including the infusion of equity into APS. Decisions made by the ACC or FERC could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.33Table of ContentsAPS’s ability to conduct its business operations and avoid negative operational and financial impacts depends in part upon compliance with federal, state and local laws, judicial decisions, statutes, regulations and ACC requirements, which may be revised from time to time by legislative or other action, and obtaining and maintaining certain regulatory permits, approvals, and certificates.APS must comply in good faith with all applicable statutes, regulations, rules, tariffs, and orders of agencies that regulate APS’s business, including FERC, NRC, EPA, the ACC, and state and local governmental agencies. These agencies regulate many aspects of APS’s utility operations, including safety and performance, emissions, siting and construction of facilities, labor and employment, customer service and the rates that APS can charge retail and wholesale customers. Failure to comply can subject APS to, among other things, fines and penalties. For example, under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, FERC can impose penalties (approximately $1.2 million per day per violation) for failure to comply with mandatory electric reliability standards. APS is also required to have numerous permits, approvals and certificates from these agencies. APS believes the necessary permits, approvals and certificates have been obtained for its existing operations and that APS’s business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws in all material respects. Changes in laws or regulations that govern APS, new interpretations of laws and regulations, or the imposition of new or revised laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on the manner in which we operate our business and our results of operations. In particular, new or revised laws or interpretations of existing laws or regulations may impact or call into question the ACC’s permissive regulatory authority, which may result in uncertainty as to jurisdictional authority within our state, and uncertainty as to whether ACC decisions will be binding or challenged by other agencies or bodies asserting jurisdiction. We are unable to predict the impact on our business and operating results from any pending or future regulatory or legislative rulemaking.The operation of APS’s nuclear power plant exposes it to substantial regulatory oversight and potentially significant liabilities and capital expenditures.The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose safety-related, security-related and other licensing requirements for the operation of nuclear generating facilities. Events at nuclear facilities of other operators or impacting the industry generally may lead the NRC to impose additional requirements and regulations on all nuclear generating facilities, including Palo Verde. In the event of noncompliance with its requirements, the NRC has the authority to impose a progressively increased inspection regime that could ultimately result in the shut-down of a unit or civil penalties, or both, depending upon the NRC’s assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. The increased costs resulting from penalties, a heightened level of scrutiny and implementation of plans to achieve compliance with NRC requirements may adversely affect APS’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.APS is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations, and changes in, or liabilities under, existing or new laws or regulations may increase APS’s cost of operations or impact its business plans.APS is, or may become, subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of its present and future operations, including air emissions of conventional pollutants and GHGs, water quality, discharges of wastewater and waste streams originating from fly ash and bottom ash handling facilities, solid waste, hazardous waste, and coal combustion products, which consist of bottom ash, fly ash, and air pollution control wastes. These laws and regulations can result in increased capital, operating, and other costs, particularly with regard to enforcement efforts focused on power plant emissions obligations. They could also impact the overall business environment in Arizona and affect APS’s customer and sales growth rates. Additionally, these laws and regulations generally require APS to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, and other approvals. If there is a delay or failure to obtain any required environmental regulatory approval, or if APS fails to obtain, 34Table of Contentsmaintain, or comply with any such approval, operations at affected facilities could be suspended or subject to additional expenses. In addition, failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations could result in civil liability as a result of government enforcement actions or private claims or criminal penalties. Both public officials and private individuals may seek to enforce applicable environmental laws and regulations. APS cannot predict the outcome (financial or operational) of any related litigation that may arise.Environmental Clean Up. APS has been named as a PRP for Superfund sites in Phoenix, Arizona, and it could be named a PRP in the future for other environmental clean-up at sites identified by a regulatory body. APS cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating clean-up costs. There is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all PRPs.Coal Ash. In December 2014, the EPA issued final regulations governing the handling and disposal of CCR, which are generated as a result of burning coal and consist of, among other things, fly ash and bottom ash. The rule regulates CCR as a non-hazardous waste. APS disposes of CCR in ash ponds and dry storage areas. To the extent the rule requires the closure or modification of these CCR units, modification or changes to the manner of closure of such units, or the construction of new CCR units beyond what we currently anticipate, APS would incur significant additional costs for CCR disposal. In addition, the rule may also require corrective action to address releases from CCR disposal units or the presence of CCR constituents within groundwater near CCR disposal units above certain regulatory thresholds. Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards. In 2015, the EPA finalized revisions to the NAAQS for ozone, which set new, more stringent standards on emissions of nitrogen oxide, a precursor to ozone, in an effort to protect human health and human welfare. Depending on the final attainment designations for the new standards and the state implementation requirements, APS may be required to invest in new pollution control technologies and to generate emission offsets for new projects or facility expansions located in ozone nonattainment areas. In addition, the EPA may in the future further increase the stringency of various NAAQS, including for ozone or other pollutants, such as particulate matter. With regard to even more stringent NAAQS requirements, additional control measures and compliance costs may become necessary for APS as well as its current and potential future customers.APS cannot assure that existing environmental regulations will not be revised or that new regulations seeking to protect the environment will not be adopted or become applicable to it. Revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, particularly if those costs incurred by APS are not fully recoverable from APS’s customers, could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Due to current or potential future regulations or legislation coupled with trends in natural gas and coal prices, or other clean energy rules or initiatives, the economics or feasibility of continuing to own certain resources, particularly coal facilities, may deteriorate, warranting early retirement of those plants, which may result in asset impairments. APS would seek recovery in rates for the book value of any remaining investments in the plants as well as other costs related to early retirement but cannot predict whether it would obtain such recovery. Such regulations may also act as a deterrent to future customer growth or create additional costs for existing customers, potentially slowing APS’s customer growth. APS faces potential financial risks resulting from climate change litigation and legislative and regulatory efforts to limit GHG emissions, as well as physical and operational risks related to climate effects.35Table of ContentsConcern over climate change has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit CO2, which is a major byproduct of the combustion of fossil fuel, and other GHG emissions. Potential Financial Risks — Greenhouse Gas Regulation, the Clean Power Plan and Potential Litigation. On April 25, 2024, the EPA issued new GHG emission standards for power plants. These new standards are focused on limiting power plant GHG emissions through control mechanisms that can be implemented at individual power plant facilities. The new regulations are currently being challenged in federal court. Additionally, the Trump administration has stated that it intends to reverse or substantially revise these standards. See Item 1 - Environmental Matters - Climate Change for more information. Depending on the outcome of carbon emission rulemaking under the Clean Air Act targeting new and existing power plants, the utility industry may become subject to more stringent and expansive regulations. Depending on the means of compliance with federal emission performance standards, the electric utility industry may be forced to incur substantial costs necessary to achieve compliance. In addition, we anticipate that such regulations will be challenged in federal court prior to their implementation. Depending on the outcome of such judicial review, the utility industry may face alternative efforts from private parties seeking to establish alternative GHG emission limitations from power plants. Alternative GHG emission limitations may arise from litigation under either federal or state common laws or citizen suit provisions of federal environmental statutes that attempt to force federal agency rulemaking or impose direct facility emission limitations. Such lawsuits may also seek damages from harm alleged to have resulted from power plant GHG emissions.Physical and Operational Risks. Weather extremes such as drought and high temperature variations are common occurrences in the southwestern United States’ desert area, and these are risks that APS considers in the normal course of business in the engineering and construction of its electric system. Large increases in ambient temperatures could require evaluation of certain materials used within its system and may represent a greater challenge. Limitations on water supplies necessary to operate electric generation infrastructure could arise from prolonged drought and shortage declarations associated with key surface water resources. As part of conducting its business, APS recognizes that the southwestern United States is particularly susceptible to the risks posed by climate change, which over time is projected to exacerbate high temperature extremes and prolong drought in the area where APS conducts its business.Co-owners of our jointly owned generation and transmission facilities may have unaligned goals and positions due to the effects of legislation, regulations, economic conditions, or changes in our industry, which could have a significant impact on our ability to continue operations of such facilities.APS owns certain of its power plants and transmission facilities jointly with other owners, with varying ownership interests in such facilities. Changes in the nature of our industry and the economic viability of certain plants and facilities, including impacts resulting from types and availability of other resources, fuel costs, legislation, and regulation, together with timing considerations related to the expiration of leases or other agreements for such facilities, could result in unaligned positions among co-owners. Differences in the co-owners’ willingness or ability to continue their participation could lead to the eventual shut down of units or facilities and uncertainty related to the resulting cost recovery of such assets. See Note 3 for a discussion of the Navajo Plant and Cholla retirement and the related risks associated with APS’s continued recovery of its remaining investment in the plant.Deregulation or restructuring of the electric industry may result in increased competition, which could have a significant adverse impact on APS’s business and its results of operations.In November 2018, the ACC voted to re-examine the facilitation of a deregulated retail electric market in Arizona. On July 1 and July 2, 2019, ACC Staff issued a report and initial proposed draft rules regarding possible modifications to the ACC’s retail electric competition rules. On February 10, 2020, two ACC Commissioners filed two sets of draft proposed retail electric competition rules. On February 12, 36Table of Contents2020, ACC Staff issued its second report regarding possible modifications to the ACC’s retail electric competition rules. During a July 15, 2020, ACC Staff meeting, the ACC Commissioners discussed the possible development of a retail competition pilot program, but no action was taken. The ACC continues to discuss matters related to retail electric competition, including the potential for additional buy-through programs or other pilot programs. In April 2022, the Arizona Legislature passed, and the Governor signed, a bill that repealed the electric deregulation law that had been in place in Arizona since 1998. On August 27, 2024, the ACC administratively closed this docket due to inactivity and obsolescence. Modification of the ACC’s retail electric competition rules or other efforts of deregulation could result in increased competition, which could have a significant adverse impact on APS’s business and results of operations.OPERATIONAL RISKSAPS’s results of operations can be adversely affected by various factors impacting demand for electricity.Weather Conditions. Weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and affect the price of energy commodities. Electric power demand is generally a seasonal business. In Arizona, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time. As a result, APS’s overall operating results fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. In addition, APS has historically sold less power, and consequently earned less income, when weather conditions are milder. As a result, unusually mild weather could diminish APS’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.Apart from the impact on electricity demand, weather conditions related to prolonged high temperatures or extreme heat events present operational challenges. In the southwestern United States, where APS conducts its business, the effects of climate change are projected to increase the overall average temperature, lead to more extreme temperature events, and exacerbate prolonged drought conditions leading to the declining availability of water resources. Extreme heat events and rising temperatures are projected to reduce the generation capacity of thermal-power plants and decrease the efficiency of the transmission grid. These operational risks related to rising temperatures and extreme heat events could affect APS’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Higher temperatures may decrease the snowpack, which might result in lowered soil moisture and an increased threat of wildfires. Wildfires could threaten APS’s communities and electric transmission lines and facilities. Any damage caused as a result of wildfires could negatively impact APS’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, the decrease in snowpack can also lead to reduced water supplies in the areas where APS relies upon non-renewable water resources to supply cooling and process water for electricity generation. Prolonged and extreme drought conditions can also affect APS’s long-term ability to access the water resources necessary for thermal electricity generation operations. Reductions in the availability of water for power plant cooling could negatively impact APS’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.Effects of Energy Conservation Measures and Distributed Energy Resources. APS customers in energy efficiency and conservation programs and other demand-side management efforts, which in turn impact the demand for electricity. APS must also meet certain distributed renewable energy requirements. A portion of APS’s total renewable energy requirement must be met with an increasing percentage of distributed renewable energy resources (generally, small-scale renewable technologies located on customers’ properties). The distributed renewable energy requirement is 30% of the applicable RES requirement for 2012 and subsequent years (APS requested a waiver of this requirement in the 2024 and 2025 RES Implementation Plans, which have not yet been approved by the ACC). Customer participation 37Table of Contentsin distributed renewable energy programs would result in lower demand since customers would be meeting some of their own energy needs.In addition to these rules and requirements, energy efficiency technologies and distributed energy resources continue to evolve, which may have similar impacts on the demand for electricity. Reduced demand due to these energy efficiency requirements, distributed energy requirements and other emerging technologies, unless substantially offset through ratemaking mechanisms, could have a material adverse impact on APS’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Actual and Projected Customer and Sales Growth. APS’s actual sales growth, excluding weather-related variations, may differ from its projections as a result of numerous factors, such as economic conditions, customer growth, the legal, regulatory, and business environment in Arizona, usage patterns and energy conservation, slower than expected ramp-up of and/or fewer than expected data centers and large manufacturing facilities, slower than expected commercial and industrial expansions, impacts of energy efficiency programs and growth in DG, responses to retail price changes, changes in regulatory standards, and impacts of new and existing laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations. Based on past experience, a 1% variation in our annual residential and small commercial and industrial kWh sales projections under normal business conditions can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of approximately $24 million, and a 1% variation in our annual large commercial and industrial kWh sales projections under normal business conditions can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of approximately $6 million.Longer term, APS has been preparing for and can serve significant load growth from residential and business customers. On top of these existing growth trends, APS is also now receiving unprecedented incremental requests for service from extra-large commercial energy users (over 25 MW) with very high energy demands that persist virtually around-the-clock. These incremental requests for service by extra-large energy users far exceed available generation and transmission resource capacity in the Southwest region for the foreseeable future. APS is exploring available options for securing sufficient electric generation and transmission to meet these projections of future customer needs; however, there are difficulties in properly forecasting the demands of these extra-large customers due to factors such as the nascent nature of the industries (e.g., artificial intelligence) that these customers are supporting and the multiple variables that impact their usage ramp-up and ultimate level of demand. As data center and other extra-large customer opportunities evolve and develop, we may also enter into arrangements with customers and potential customers that require us to invest capital and assume credit risk related to such developments and the related generation and transmission investments before we receive any potential return. APS is implementing strategies to attempt to reduce this risk; however, the difficulty in forecasting these demands and the additional risk of these arrangements could lead to stranded costs and other effects that could have material adverse impacts on APS’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. The operation of power generation facilities and transmission systems involves risks that could result in reduced output or unscheduled outages or could otherwise significantly impact APS’s results of operations.The operation of power generation, transmission and distribution facilities involves certain risks, including the risk of breakdown or failure of equipment, fuel interruption, and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency. Unscheduled outages, including extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other complications, occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of APS’s business. Because our transmission facilities are interconnected with those of third parties, the operation of our facilities could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events occurring on the larger transmission power grid, and the operation or failure of our facilities could adversely affect the operations of others. Concerns over the physical security of these assets could include damage to certain of our 38Table of Contentsfacilities due to vandalism or other deliberate acts that could lead to outages or other adverse effects. If APS’s facilities operate below expectations, especially during its peak seasons, it may lose revenue or incur additional expenses, including increased purchased power expenses. Additionally, as APS’s transmission infrastructure ages and its transmission system needs grow to support growth in our territory and in the Southwest, it will need to replace and expand certain portions of its transmission infrastructure, which requires significant investment of capital. Risks related to the timely completion of, and costs associated with, these projects may be exacerbated by a constrained supply chain limiting the availability of necessary parts and materials as well as APS’s use, in some cases, of older, obsolete, or unsupported equipment. Certain replacements and expansions of the transmission infrastructure will also require the acquisition or renewal of land leases, easements, or other rights-of-way that may require approvals from landowners, including individuals, governmental agencies, and, at times, tribal nations. APS is unable to predict the outcomes of any pending or future required approvals, including any related costs, which could be significant. If APS is unable to successfully manage the replacement and expansion of its transmission infrastructure, it could face increased equipment failures, power quality challenges, reputational impact, and financial loss.The impact of wildfires could negatively affect APS’s results of operations.Wildfires have the potential to affect communities within APS’s service territory and the surrounding areas, as well as APS’s vast network of electric transmission and distribution lines and facilities. The potential likelihood and severity of wildfires has increased due to many of the same weather and climate change impacts existing in Arizona as those that led to catastrophic wildfires in other states. The continued expansion of the wildland urban interface has also increased wildfire risk to surrounding communities. Extreme weather events such as severe storms and strong wind gusts may also increase the likelihood of a wildfire in our service territory. APS has a Comprehensive Wildfire Mitigation Plan (“CWMP”) that employs various strategies designed to prevent, mitigate, and respond to wildfire risks. APS’s CWMP includes vegetation management and clearing protocols, operational measures and a public safety power shut off program (“PSPS”) on certain feeders, among other practices. However, APS’s fire mitigation efforts may be insufficient to prevent wildfires in APS’s expansive service territory and surrounding areas and could result in claims alleging damages due to the use, non-use, timing, or effectiveness of such measures. In addition, APS could be sued regardless of fault for damages incurred as a result of wildfires and may not be able to recover all or a substantial portion of any such damages or costs from insurance or through rates. In addition, we could also experience credit rating downgrades, reputational harm, volatility in the market for our common stock, and significant financial distress upon the occurrence of a wildfire event. Furthermore, any damage caused to our assets, loss of service to our customers, or liability imposed as a result of wildfires could negatively impact APS’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.The inability to successfully develop, acquire or operate generation resources to meet future resource needs and load forecasts in accordance with reliability requirements and other new or evolving standards and regulations could adversely impact our business.Potential changes in regulatory standards, impacts of new and existing laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations, and the need to obtain various regulatory approvals create uncertainty surrounding our current and future generation portfolio. The current regulatory standards, laws, and regulations create strategic challenges as to the appropriate generation portfolio and fuel diversification mix. In addition, APS is required by the ACC to meet certain energy resource portfolio requirements, including those related to renewables development and energy efficiency measures, in addition to specific competitive resource procurement requirements. The development and operation of any generation facility is also subject to many risks, including those related to financing, siting, permitting, new and evolving technology, extreme weather events, workforce issues, cybersecurity attacks, supply 39Table of Contentschain constraints for critical spare parts, and the construction of sufficient transmission capacity to support these facilities among others. APS needs to develop or acquire new generation facilities, potentially modernize existing facilities, and/or contract for additional capacity in order to meet future resource needs and load forecasts. APS’s inability to do so could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.In expressing concerns about the environmental and climate-related impacts from continued extraction, transportation, delivery and combustion of fossil fuels, environmental advocacy groups and other third parties have in recent years undertaken greater efforts to oppose the permitting, construction, and operation of fossil fuel infrastructure projects. These efforts may increase in scope and frequency depending on a number of variables, including the future course of Federal environmental regulation and the increasing financial resources devoted to these opposition activities. APS cannot predict the effect that any such opposition may have on our ability to develop, construct, and operate fossil fuel infrastructure projects in the future. In January 2020, APS announced its goal to provide 100% clean, carbon-free electricity by 2050 with an intermediate 2030 target of achieving a resource mix that is 65% clean energy, with 45% of the generation portfolio coming from renewable energy. APS’s ability to successfully execute its clean energy commitment is dependent upon a number of external factors, some of which include supportive national and state energy policies, a supportive regulatory environment, sales and customer growth, the development, deployment and advancement of clean energy technologies, adequate supply chain for generation resources, and continued access to capital markets.The lack of access to sufficient supplies of water could have a material adverse impact on APS’s business and results of operations.Assured supplies of water are important for APS’s generating plants. Water in the southwestern United States is limited, and various parties have made conflicting claims regarding the right to access and use such limited supplies of water. Both groundwater and surface water in areas important to the operation of APS’s generating plants have been and are the subject of inquiries, claims and legal proceedings. In addition, the region in which APS’s power plants are located suffers from prolonged drought conditions, which could potentially affect the plants’ water supplies. Climate change is also projected to exacerbate such drought conditions. In addition, Colorado River water supplies for Arizona are subject to a Tier 1 shortage declaration, which substantially limits the quantity of water available for the state. APS’s inability to access sufficient supplies of water, along with that of its customers, could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.We are subject to cybersecurity risks and risks of unauthorized access to our systems that could adversely affect our business and financial condition.We operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure. In the regular course of our business, we handle a range of sensitive security, customer, and business systems information. There appears to be an increasing level of activity, sophistication, and maturity of threat actors, including from both nation-state and non-nation state actors, that seek to exploit potential vulnerabilities in the electric utility industry and wish to disrupt the U.S. bulk power system, our information technology systems, generation (including our Palo Verde nuclear facility), transmission and distribution facilities, and other infrastructure facilities and systems and physical assets. We have been and could be the target of attacks, and the aforementioned systems are critical areas of cyber protection for us. We rely extensively on IT systems, networks, and services, including internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities, and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms. Some of these systems are managed, hosted, provided, or used by third parties to assist in conducting our business. 40Table of ContentsMalicious actors may attack vendors to disrupt the services these vendors provide to us or to use those vendors as a cyber conduit to attack us. As more third parties are involved in the operation of our business, there is a risk the confidentiality, integrity, privacy, or security of data held by, or accessible to, third parties may be compromised.If a significant cybersecurity event or breach were to occur, we may not be able to fulfill critical business functions and we could (i) experience property damage, disruptions to our business, theft of or unauthorized access to customer, employee, financial or system operation information or other information; (ii) experience loss of revenue or incur significant costs for repair, remediation and breach notification, and increased capital and operating costs to implement increased security measures; and (iii) be subject to increased regulation, litigation and reputational damage. If such disruptions or breaches are not detected quickly, their effects could be compounded or could delay our response or the effectiveness of our response and ability to limit our exposure to potential liability. These types of events would also require significant management attention and resources and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.We develop and maintain systems and processes aimed at detecting and preventing information and cybersecurity incidents which require significant investment, maintenance, and ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies and regulatory requirements change. These systems and processes may be insufficient to mitigate the possibility of cybersecurity incidents, malicious social engineering, fraudulent or other malicious activities, and human error or malfeasance in the safeguarding of our data.We are subject to laws and rules issued by multiple government agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining the confidentiality of our security, customer information and business information. One of these agencies, NERC, has issued comprehensive regulations and standards surrounding the security of bulk power systems and is continually in the process of developing updated and additional requirements with which the utility industry must comply. The NRC also has issued regulations and standards related to the protection of critical digital assets at commercial nuclear power plants. The increasing promulgation of NERC and NRC rules and standards will increase our compliance costs and our exposure to the potential risk of violations of the standards. Experiencing a cybersecurity incident could cause us to be non-compliant with applicable laws and regulations, such as those promulgated by NERC and the NRC, privacy laws, or contracts that require us to securely maintain confidential data, causing us to incur costs related to legal claims or proceedings and regulatory fines or penalties.The risk of these system-related events and security breaches occurring continues to intensify. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, threats and attempted intrusions to our information technology systems and we could experience such threats and attempted intrusions to our operational control systems. To date, we do not believe we have experienced a material breach or disruption to our network or information systems or our service operations. We may not be able to anticipate and prevent all cyberattacks or information security breaches, and our ongoing investments in security resources, talent, and business practices may not be effective against all threat actors.We maintain cyber insurance to provide coverage for a portion of the losses and damages that may result from a security breach of our information technology systems, but such insurance is subject to a number of exclusions and may not cover the total loss or damage caused by a breach. Coverage for cybersecurity events continues to evolve as the industry matures. In the future, adequate insurance may not be available at rates that we believe are reasonable, and the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident may not be covered by insurance or recoverable in rates.41Table of ContentsThere are inherent risks in the ownership and operation of nuclear facilities, such as environmental, health, fuel supply, spent fuel disposal, regulatory and financial risks and the risk of terrorist attack that could adversely affect our business and financial condition.APS has an ownership interest in and operates on behalf of a group of participants, Palo Verde, which is the largest nuclear electric generating facility in the western United States. Palo Verde constitutes approximately 18% of APS’s owned and leased generation capacity. Palo Verde is subject to environmental, health and financial risks, such as the ability to obtain adequate supplies of nuclear fuel; the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel; the ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning; potential liabilities arising out of the operation of these facilities; the costs of securing the facilities against possible terrorist attacks; and unscheduled outages due to equipment and other problems. APS maintains nuclear decommissioning trust funds and external insurance coverage to minimize its financial exposure to some of these risks; however, it is possible that damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage. APS may be required under federal law to pay up to $144.9 million (but not more than $21.6 million per year) of liabilities arising out of a nuclear incident not only at Palo Verde, but at any other nuclear power plant in the United States. In addition, APS is subject to retrospective premium adjustments under its nuclear property insurance policies with Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (“NEIL”) for approximately $23.1 million if NEIL’s losses in any policy year exceed accumulated funds and if the retrospective premium assessment is declared by NEIL’s Board of Directors. Although APS has no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at Palo Verde, if an incident did occur, it could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit and to promulgate new regulations that could require significant capital expenditures and/or increase operating costs.Changes in technology could create challenges for APS’s existing business.Alternative energy technologies that produce power or reduce power consumption or emissions are being developed and commercialized, including renewable technologies such as photovoltaic (solar) cells, customer-sited generation, energy storage (batteries) and efficiency technologies. Advances in technology and equipment/appliance efficiency could reduce the demand for supply from conventional generation, including carbon-free nuclear generation, and increase the complexity of managing APS’s information technology and power system operations, which could adversely affect APS’s business.Customer-sited alternative energy technologies present challenges to APS’s operations due to misalignment with APS’s existing operational needs. When these resources lack “dispatchability” and other elements of utility-side control, they are considered “unmanaged” resources. The cumulative effect of such unmanaged resources results in added complexity for APS’s system management.APS continues to pursue and implement advanced grid technologies, including transmission and distribution system technologies and digital meters enabling two-way communications between the utility and its customers. Many of the products and processes resulting from these and other alternative technologies, including energy storage technologies, have not yet been widely used or tested on a long-term basis, and their use on large-scale systems is not as established or mature as APS’s existing technologies and equipment. The implementation of new and additional technologies adds complexity to our information technology and operational technology systems, which could require additional infrastructure and resources. APS’s strategy, including the timing of such strategy, in adopting new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, could also adversely impact APS’s business. For example, if APS fails to strategically implement artificial intelligence, it could miss the opportunity for cost savings, face increasing costs on legacy systems, insufficiently integrate internal and external data sets, or invest in low data quality, risk misusing artificial intelligence, impact employee satisfaction with its implementation of or failure to implement artificial intelligence and other technologies. Widespread installation and 42Table of Contentsacceptance of new technologies could also enable the entry of new market participants, such as technology companies, into the interface between APS and its customers and could have other unpredictable effects on APS’s traditional business model.Deployment of renewable energy technologies is expected to continue across the western states and result in a larger portion of the overall energy production coming from these sources. These trends, which have benefited from historical and continuing government support for certain technologies, have the potential to put downward pressure on wholesale power prices throughout the western states which could make APS’s existing generating facilities less economical and impact their operational patterns and long-term viability. We are subject to employee workforce factors that could adversely affect our business and financial condition.Like many companies in the electric utility industry, our workforce is maturing, with approximately 27.4% of employees eligible to retire by the end of 2029. Although we have undertaken efforts to recruit, train and develop new employees, we face increased competition for talent. We are subject to other employee workforce factors, such as the availability and retention of qualified personnel and the need to negotiate collective bargaining agreements with union employees. These or other employee workforce factors could negatively impact our business, financial condition, or results of operations.FINANCIAL RISKSA downgrade of our credit ratings could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our current ratings are set forth in “Liquidity and Capital Resources — Credit Ratings” in Item 7. We cannot be sure that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. Any downgrade or withdrawal could adversely affect the market price of Pinnacle West’s and APS’s securities, limit our access to capital and increase our borrowing costs, which would adversely impact our financial results. We could be required to pay a higher interest rate for future financings, and our potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease. In addition, borrowing costs under our existing credit facilities depend on our credit ratings. A downgrade could also require us to provide additional support in the form of letters of credit or cash or other collateral to various counterparties. If our short-term ratings were to be lowered, it could severely limit access to the commercial paper market. We note that the ratings from rating agencies are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities and that each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.Investment performance, changing interest rates, new rules or regulations and other economic, social, and political factors could decrease the value of our benefit plan assets, nuclear decommissioning trust funds and other special use funds or increase the valuation of our related obligations, resulting in significant additional funding requirements. We are also subject to risks related to the provision of employee healthcare benefits and healthcare reform legislation. Any inability to fully recover these costs in our utility rates would negatively impact our financial condition.We have significant pension plan and other postretirement benefits plan obligations to our employees and retirees, and legal obligations to fund our pension trust and nuclear decommissioning trusts for Palo Verde. We hold and invest substantial assets in these trusts that are designed to provide funds to pay for certain of these obligations as they arise. Declines in market values of the fixed income and equity securities held in these trusts may increase our funding requirements for the related trusts. Additionally, the valuation of liabilities related to our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans are impacted by a discount rate, which is the interest rate used to discount future pension and other postretirement 43Table of Contentsbenefit obligations. Changes in interest rates impact the discount rate and valuation of the plan liabilities, and may result in increases in pension and other postretirement benefit costs, cash contributions, regulatory assets, and charges to OCI. Changes in demographics, including increased number of retirements or changes in life expectancy and changes in other actuarial assumptions, may also result in similar impacts. The minimum contributions required under these plans are impacted by federal legislation and related regulations. Increasing liabilities or otherwise increasing funding requirements under these plans, resulting from adverse changes in legislation or otherwise, could result in significant cash funding obligations that could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.We recover most of the pension and other postretirement benefit expense and all of the currently estimated nuclear decommissioning costs in our regulated rates. Any inability to fully recover these costs in a timely manner could have a material negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.Pending or future federal or state legislative or regulatory activity or court proceedings could increase the costs of providing medical insurance for our employees and retirees. Any potential changes and resulting cost impacts cannot be determined with certainty at this time.Our cash flow depends on the performance of APS and its ability to make distributions.We derive essentially all of our revenues and earnings from our wholly-owned subsidiary, APS. Accordingly, our cash flow and our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of APS and its distributions to us. APS is a separate and distinct legal entity and has no obligation to make distributions to us.APS’s financing agreements may restrict its ability to pay dividends, make distributions or otherwise transfer funds to us. In addition, an ACC financing order requires APS to maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40% and does not allow APS to pay common dividends if the payment would reduce its common equity below that threshold. The common equity ratio, as defined in the ACC order, is total shareholder equity divided by the sum of total shareholder equity and long-term debt, including current maturities of long-term debt.We may not have adequate insurance coverage for liabilities. The operation of power generation, transmission and distribution facilities involves hazardous activities. We may become exposed to significant liabilities for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage or risk mitigation. Additionally, through our captive insurance cell, we take certain insurance risk on our business, such as certain wildfire coverage, excess property insurance, and excess employment practice liability. We maintain an amount of insurance protection that we believe is customary, but there can be no assurance it will be sufficient or effective in light of all circumstances, hazards or liabilities to which we may be subject. Our insurance does not cover every potential risk associated with our operations. Adequate coverage at reasonable rates is not a",49799,rf,20250225,2025,10K,real_textdata_2025

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSINTRODUCTION The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Financial Statements and APS’s Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes that appear in Item 8 of this report. This discussion provides a comparison of the 2024 results with 2023 results. For the discussion of 2023 compared to 2022, see Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Pinnacle West Capital Corporation’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which specific discussion is incorporated herein by reference. For information on factors that may cause our actual future results to differ from those we currently seek or anticipate, see “Forward-Looking Statements” at the front of this report and “Risk Factors” in Item 1A.OVERVIEW Business Overview Pinnacle West is an investor-owned electric utility holding company based in Phoenix, Arizona with consolidated assets of approximately $26 billion. Since 1886, Pinnacle West and our affiliates have provided energy and energy-related products to people and businesses throughout Arizona. Pinnacle West derives essentially all of our revenues and earnings from our principal subsidiary, APS. APS is Arizona’s largest and longest-serving electric company that generates safe, affordable and reliable electricity for approximately 1.4 million retail customers in 11 of Arizona’s 15 counties. APS is also the operator and co-owner of Palo Verde — a primary source of electricity for the southwestern United States. Strategic Overview Our strategy is to create a sustainable energy future for Arizona that delivers shareholder value and shared value by serving our customers with reliable, affordable, and clean energy.Customer-FocusedAPS’s focus remains on its customers and the communities it serves. Accordingly, it is APS’s goal to achieve an industry-leading, best-in-class customer experience. This multi-year objective includes incrementally improving APS’s J.D. Power (“JDP”) residential and business customer satisfaction ratings from the fourth to the top of second quartile for its customers. For 2024, APS ranked at the top of the second quartile for large investor-owned utilities for both business and residential customers, with the residential results being APS’s highest rank and placement since 2016.In furtherance of a customer-centric culture, APS employees have delivered an enhanced customer experience in recent years through a number of past and ongoing initiatives, such as improving the ease-of-use of APS’s automated phone system, improving the speed of answering customer calls, advancing phone advisor soft skill development through updated training curriculum, and adding 1,100-plus in-person payment locations, as well as introducing new customer payment channels. Recently, APS redesigned its customer bills with the aim of increasing personalization and helping customers better understand their 57Table of Contents energy use and find ways to save. APS also implemented numerous enhancements to its website, including improving page-loading speeds, adding user-friendly dashboards, and making content more simple, relevant, and useful. APS enhanced other customer touchpoints, such as communications throughout outages and the online outage center in addition to continuing to communicate with customers in their preferred channels about topics that matter most to them, such as reliability, energy-efficiency, financial assistance, the environment, and programs that enable them to design their own personalized energy experience. Finally, APS continues to focus on employee learning, training, tools, and resources to ensure all employees understand their role in APS customers’ experiences.Additionally, APS has implemented a variety of financial assistance programs to support customers struggling to pay their energy bills. Among these assistance programs are discounts for qualified limited-income customers, including a new tier with larger discounts for APS’s lowest income customers added in the second quarter of 2024 and other non-income-based assistance programs, such as flexible payment arrangements and emergency utility bill assistance. To ensure our most vulnerable customers are connected to these programs, we train and partner with more than one hundred community action agencies across our service territory.ReliableWhile our energy mix evolves, APS’s commitment to deliver reliable service to our customers remains. APS is managing through significant growth in the Phoenix metropolitan area while experiencing supply chain issues similar to those experienced in other industries. Planned investments will support operating and maintaining the grid, updating technology, accommodating customer growth, and enabling more renewable energy resources. To prioritize reliability and meet substantial growth in customer energy needs, APS has developed a future-focused, strategic transmission plan (the “Ten-Year Transmission Plan”). The Ten-Year Transmission Plan includes five critical transmission projects that comprise the APS strategic transmission portfolio, which represent a significant upgrade to our transmission system. These five projects, along with other projects included in the Ten-Year Transmission Plan, will support growing energy needs, strengthen reliability, and allow for the connection of new resources.Our advanced distribution management system allows operators to locate outages and control line devices remotely and helps them coordinate more closely with field crews to safely maintain an increasingly dynamic grid. The system will also integrate a new meter data management system that will increase grid visibility and give customers access to more of their energy usage data. Wildfire safety remains a critical focus for APS and other utilities. We have increased investment in fire mitigation efforts to clear defensible space around our infrastructure, continue ongoing system upgrades, build partnerships with government entities and first responders and educate customers and communities. We also increased spend on mitigating the risk associated with trees that could cause hazards, resulting in more of these trees being removed before they could cause outages or wildfires. These programs contribute to customer reliability, responsible forest management and safe communities. With recent wildfire events in Hawaii, California, and across North America, we have been devoting and will continue to devote substantial efforts to analyzing and developing enhancements to our systems and processes to mitigate fire risk within our service territory and communities, including by hardening our infrastructure, deploying new technologies where appropriate, increasing our awareness, implementing operational changes, and enhancing our wildfire response capabilities. APS completed implementation of fire modelling software that we are utilizing to more surgically identify and calculate risk and target future 58Table of Contents system improvement investments such as fire-resistant pole wrapping, wood to steel pole conversions, and additional remote-controllable field devices like reclosers and switches. In 2024, APS began installing a system of artificial intelligence-based fire sensing cameras with the ability to detect and alert on fire ignitions. These alerts are sent both to APS and fire response dispatch centers to speed fire response in APS’s service territory regardless of the cause of the fire. APS also implemented a PSPS program on certain feeders that began in the 2024 fire season, leveraging the additional real-time analysis provided by the new modelling software, and has educated and is continuing education outreach to customers and communities that may potentially be impacted by the PSPS program. APS continues to evaluate policy and regulatory options, as well as insurance programs, to mitigate the impact of wildfire events.For example, on August 14, 2024, APS filed a request with the ACC for a deferral order that would authorize APS to defer, for future recovery in rates, operations and maintenance expenses associated with wildfire management, including increased insurance costs. APS cannot predict the outcome of this matter. See Note 3 for more information. Additionally, APS was selected by the DOE’s Grid Deployment Office (“GDO”) to receive up to $70 million in federal money for fire mitigation and grid infrastructure projects. This funding is part of the GDO’s Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnership Program and is contingent on APS negotiating and executing final grant agreements with GDO.Maintaining reliability and affordability for customers during the clean energy transition is fundamental to APS’s strategy. Dispatchable natural gas generators provide energy during times when intermittent resources, such as solar and wind, are insufficient to meet customer demand. In addition to the previously added natural gas units at the modernized Ocotillo Power Plant in 2019 and efficiency improvements to gas units at the Redhawk, Sundance, and West Phoenix Power Plants in 2024, APS has contracted for two simple cycle combustion turbines (approximately 90 MW in total) at Sundance, which are expected to be in service in 2026, and eight simple cycle combustion turbines (approximately 397 MW in total) at Redhawk, which are expected to be in service in 2028. APS continues to evaluate and pursue options for reliably serving growing customer energy needs and demand.In October 2021, APS announced plans to evaluate regional market solutions as part of the Western Markets Exploratory Group (“WMEG”). As a member of WMEG, APS explored the potential for a staged approach to new market services, including day-ahead energy sales, transmission system expansion, and other power supply and grid solutions consistent with existing regulations and known and expected market design. APS utilizes the work done by WMEG to help identify market solutions that can help achieve carbon reduction goals while supporting reliable, affordable service for customers.APS went live with a new Energy Management System (“EMS”) in April 2024. APS expects the new EMS to provide a better foundation which will improve future integration of the renewable and energy storage assets into APS’s generation resource portfolio, allowing APS to maximize the flexibility of its resources and fully engage in the Western Energy Imbalance Market (“WEIM”). APS also believes it will better position APS to participate in market opportunities that develop over the next decade.APS’s key elements to delivering reliable power include resource and transmission planning, sufficient reserve margins, partnering with customers to manage peak demand, fire mitigation, and operational preparedness, among others. Seasonal readiness procedures at APS include inspections to ensure good material conditions and critical control system surveys. APS also plans for the unexpected by conducting emergency operations drills and coordinating with federal, state, and local agencies on fire and emergency management.59Table of Contents Affordable APS continues to focus on mitigating the cost pressures related to inflation and other factors, such as tariffs. Overall inflation grew by 1.6% in Phoenix and 2.9% nationally over the twelve months ended December 2024. Although inflationary impacts to APS began to slow in 2024, APS is still managing the impacts high inflation. Additionally, the implementation of recent and future tariffs could further escalate costs and introduce supply chain constraints.APS’s customer affordability initiative includes internal opportunities, such as training and mentoring employees on identifying efficiency opportunities; maintaining an inventory to take advantage of lower pricing and avoid expediting fees; entering into long-term contracts to hedge against price volatility, which has allowed APS to mitigate against procurement spend areas such as transformers; and implementing automation technologies to enhance efficiencies and increase data-oriented decision making.There are also external opportunities under APS’s customer affordability initiative, such as APS’s participation in the WEIM. WEIM continues to be a tool for creating savings for APS’s customers from the real-time, voluntary market. APS continues to expect that its participation in WEIM will lower its fuel and purchased-power costs, improve situational awareness for system operations in the Western Interconnection power grid, and improve integration of APS’s renewable resources. APS participated in market design and tariff development of Markets+, a day-ahead and real-time market offering from Southwest Power Pool (“SPP”). The Markets+ tariff was filed with FERC on March 29, 2024 and was approved on January 16, 2025. APS announced a market decision to pursue participation in SPP Markets+. In addition, APS is participating in the Western Resource Adequacy Program administered by Western Power Pool and is transitioning to full binding participation as early as summer 2027. These regional efforts are driven by the objectives of reducing customer cost and improving reliability.In terms of generation affordability, every three years, APS performs a comprehensive study, called an Integrated Resource Plan (“IRP”), to identify what resources will be necessary to safely and reliably meet the demand and energy needs of its customers over the next 15 years. In November 2023, APS released its latest IRP, which identified forecasted customer demand and energy needs growing at an unprecedented rate. In developing the IRP, APS considered how factors such as forecasted economic growth, impacts from weather, and new resource technology availability impact the amount and type of resources required to reliably meet customer needs. These factors, among others, were used to develop a plan that identified a balanced mix of diverse energy generating resources to reliably serve customers’ future energy needs in the most affordable and sustainable manner possible. To help ensure competitive costs for resources procured by APS, APS regularly issues competitive bid solicitations through the ASRFP process, with the most recent ASRFPs being issued in 2022, 2023, and 2024. These ASRFPs are open to bids for all resource types, including customer-scale (behind the meter) and utility-scale (in front of the meter) resources. Through the ASRFP process, APS has found that clean resources like wind, solar, and energy storage technology, are important elements of a least cost portfolio. During the clean energy transition, dispatchable resources will play a vital role in maintaining grid reliability by serving as a back-up to intermittent energy resources when output is insufficient to meet customer needs. Over the long term, each resource in a balanced and diverse portfolio is expected to provide complementary value and contribute to sustained delivery of reliable electric service. In addition to managing the cost of electricity generation, APS has continued building upon existing cost management efforts, including a customer affordability initiative launched in 2019. The initiative was implemented company-wide to thoughtfully and deliberately assess our business processes 60Table of Contents and organizational approaches to completing high-value work and achieving internal efficiencies. APS continues to drive this initiative by identifying opportunities to streamline its business processes, mitigate cost increases, increase employee retention, and improve customer satisfaction.Clean Energy CommitmentWe are committed to doing our part to build a clean and carbon-free future. As Arizona stewards, we do what is right for the people and prosperity of Arizona. Our vision is to create a sustainable energy future for Arizona by providing reliable, affordable, and clean energy to our customers. We can accomplish our vision by collaborating with customers, communities, employees, policymakers, shareholders, and other stakeholders. Our clean energy commitment is based on sound science and supports continued growth and economic development while maintaining reliability and affordable prices for APS’s customers.APS’s clean energy commitment consists of three parts: •A 2050 goal to provide 100% clean, carbon-free electricity;•A 2030 target to achieve a resource mix that is 65% clean energy, with 45% of the generation portfolio coming from renewable energy; and•A plan to exit from coal-fired generation by 2031.APS’s ability to successfully execute its clean energy commitment depends upon a number of important external factors, including a supportive regulatory environment, sales and customer growth, development of clean energy technologies, and continued access to capital markets, among others.2050 Goal: 100% Clean, Carbon-Free Electricity. Achieving a fully clean, carbon-free energy mix by 2050 is our aspiration. Achieving this 2050 goal will require, among other things, innovative thinking, emergent clean energy and storage technologies, upgrades and expansions to the grid, and supportive public policy.2030 Goal: 65% Clean Energy. APS has an energy mix that is already more than 50% clean and plans to continue to add more renewables and energy storage. By building on those plans, APS intends to attain an energy mix that is 65% clean by 2030, with 45% of APS’s generation portfolio coming from renewable energy. “Clean” is measured as percent of energy mix, which includes all carbon-free resources like nuclear, renewables, and demand-side management. “Renewable” energy includes generation resources such as solar, wind, and biomass, and is measured in accordance with the ACC Renewable Energy Standard as a percentage of retail sales. This target will serve as a checkpoint for our resource planning, investment strategy, and customer affordability efforts as APS moves toward a 100% clean, carbon-free energy mix by 2050.2031 Goal: Exit Coal-Fired Generation. The plan to exit coal-fired generation by 2031 will require APS to stop relying on coal-generation at Four Corners. APS has permanently retired more than 1,000 MW of coal-fired electric generating capacity. These closures and other measures taken by APS have resulted in annual carbon emissions that were 36% lower in 2023 compared to 2005. In addition, APS has committed to end the use of coal at its remaining Cholla units during 2025.In June 2021, APS and the owners of Four Corners entered into an agreement that would allow Four Corners to operate seasonally at the election of the owners as early as fall 2023, subject to the 61Table of Contents necessary governmental approvals and conditions associated with changes in plant ownership. Under seasonal operation, one generating unit would be shut down during seasons where electricity demand is reduced, such as the winter and spring. The other unit would remain online year-round, subject to market conditions as well as planned maintenance outages and unplanned outages. As of the date of this report, APS has elected not to begin seasonal operation due to market conditions.Renewables. APS’s IRP identifies a diverse mix of resources adequate to maintain grid reliability while serving increasing future customer energy needs. Our IRP shows that renewable and clean resources are an important part of a reliable, cost effective portfolio. APS seeks market-based pricing of procured resources through regular solicitation of project bids using its competitive ASRFP process.APS has a diverse portfolio of existing and planned resources, including solar, wind, energy storage, nuclear, geothermal, biomass and biogas, that supports our commitment to clean energy. This commitment is already strengthened by Palo Verde, one of the nation’s largest carbon-free, clean energy resources, which provides the foundation for reliable and affordable service for APS customers. APS’s longer-term clean energy strategy includes pursuing the right mix of purchased power contracts for new resources, procurement of new resources to be owned by APS, and the ongoing development of distributed energy resources. Maintaining a balanced and diverse portfolio of resources will ensure continued reliable service to our customers in the most affordable manner possible.APS uses competitive ASRFPs to pursue market-priced resources that meet its system needs and offer the best value for customers. APS selects projects based on cost, ability to meet system requirements and commercial viability, taking into consideration timing and likelihood of successful contracting and development. Under current market conditions, APS must aggressively contract for resources that can withstand supply chain and other geopolitical pressures. Guided by IRP-established timelines and quantities, APS maintains a flexible approach that allows it to optimize system reliability and customer affordability through the ASRFP process. Agreements for the development and completion of future resources are subject to various conditions, including successful siting, permitting and interconnection to the electric grid.On June 30, 2023, APS issued an ASRFP (the “2023 ASRFP”) pursuant to which APS procured nearly 7,300 MW of new resources to be in service from 2026 to 2028.On November 20, 2024, APS issued an ASRFP (the “2024 ASRFP”) seeking 2,000 MW of resources. APS is seeking projects that can reach commercial operation beginning June 1, 2028 through June 1, 2030 but will consider projects that may achieve commercial operation as early as 2026. Additionally, APS is interested in projects that require longer planning, permitting, and construction and can be commercially operational after June 1, 2030. Bids for the 2024 ASRFP were due on February 5, 2025.62Table of Contents The following table summarizes the resources in APS’s renewable energy portfolio that are in operation, planned or under development as of the date of this report. Agreements for the development and completion of future resources are subject to various conditions, including successful siting, permitting, and interconnection of the projects to the electric grid.

DG is produced in direct current and is converted to alternating current for reporting purposes.(b) Applications received by APS that are not yet installed and online.Energy Storage. APS deploys a number of advanced technologies on its system, including energy storage. Energy storage provides capacity, improves power quality, can be utilized for system regulation and, in certain circumstances, be used to defer certain traditional infrastructure investments. Energy storage also aids in integrating renewable generation by storing excess energy when system demand is low and renewable production is high and then releasing the stored energy during peak demand hours later in the day and after sunset. APS is utilizing grid-scale energy storage projects to meet customer reliability requirements, increase renewable utilization, and to further our understanding of how storage works with other advanced technologies and the grid. The following table summarizes the resources in APS’s energy storage portfolio that are in operation, planned or under development as of the date of this report.

Palo Verde, one of the nation’s largest carbon-free, clean energy resources, will continue to be a foundational part of APS’s resource portfolio. Palo Verde is not just the cornerstone of our current clean energy mix; it also is a significant provider of clean energy to the southwestern United States. The plant is a critical asset to the Southwest, generating more than 32 million MWh annually – 63Table of Contents enough power for roughly 3.4 million households, or approximately 8.5 million people. Its continued operation is important to a carbon-free and clean energy future for Arizona and the region, as a reliable, continuous, affordable resource and as a large contributor to the local economy.Developing Clean Energy TechnologiesNew Nuclear GenerationAPS, along with other Arizona electric utilities, is exploring new nuclear generation to provide around-the-clock carbon-free energy to meet rising energy demands in Arizona. APS has been monitoring emerging nuclear technologies, such as small modular nuclear reactors (“SMRs”). SMRs are typically designed to generate 300 MW or less of energy per unit compared to, for example, the 1,400 MW per unit generated at Palo Verde. The utilities have applied for a grant from the DOE to begin preliminary exploration of a potential site for additional nuclear energy for Arizona. The grant could support a three-year site selection process and possible preparation of an early site permit application to NRC. Electric Vehicles As a part of the statewide transportation electrification plan (“TE Plan”) adopted in 2021, the ACC approved a target of 450,000 light-duty electric vehicles (“EVs”) in APS’s service territory by 2030. APS’s Take Charge AZ (“TCAZ”) program has helped to deploy Level 2 EV charging stations on customer properties for fleet, public, and workplace EV charging. As of December 31, 2024, APS has installed 829 energized Level 2 charging ports at 197 customer locations. Additionally, APS has energized direct current fast charging stations that are owned and operated by APS at five locations in Arizona: Sedona, Prescott, Globe, Show Low, and Payson. Effective December 12, 2023, the TCAZ program was discontinued by the ACC. As part of that decision, APS was permitted to complete certain projects that were in process as of December 12, 2023.Additionally, as part of APS’s DSM Implementation Plan, APS launched the EV Charging Demand Management Pilot to proactively address the growing electric demand from charging as EVs become more widely adopted. The EV programs in the DSM Implementation Plan include APS SmartCharge (an EV data gathering program), Fleet Advisory Services, and a $100 rebate to home builders for new homes to be built EV-ready with 240V receptacle. APS previously offered a $250 residential rebate to customers that purchased a qualifying home Level 2 charger. Effective December 12, 2023, APS discontinued this rebate per the ACC decision. See the discussion above. APS filed its 2024 DSM Implementation Plan on November 30, 2023. The 2024 DSM Implementation Plan includes APS’s 2024 TE Plan and, among other things, proposes two new programs that were initially proposed in the 2023 DSM Implementation Plan: an expanded residential EV Managed Charging program and a Commercial EV Make-Ready Program. On April 26, 2024, APS filed an amended 2024 DSM Implementation Plan. The amended 2024 DSM Implementation Plan includes an updated budget of $90.9 million to reflect removal of incentive funds for the Level 2 Smart Charger rebate within the EV Charging Demand Management Pilot, an update on the performance incentive calculation, and the withdrawal of tranches two and three of the residential battery pilot. The amended 2024 DSM Plan is still pending ACC review and approval. APS will not file a 2025 DSM Implementation Plan, pending ACC review of the amended 2024 DSM Implementation Plan. APS cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding.64Table of Contents Carbon CaptureCarbon Capture Utilization and Storage (“CCUS”) technologies can isolate CO2 and either sequester it permanently in geologic formations or convert it for use in products. Currently, almost all existing fossil fuel generators do not control carbon emissions the way they control emissions of other air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide or oxides of nitrogen. CCUS technologies are still in the demonstration phase and while they show promise, they are still being tested in real-world conditions. These technologies could offer the potential to keep in operation existing generators that otherwise would need to be retired. APS will continue to monitor this emerging technology.Sustainability PracticesIn 2020, in support of our clean energy commitment and the growing focus on sustainability within our organization, we increased our focus on sustainability by dedicating a new Sustainability Department at Pinnacle West responsible for integrating responsible business practices into the everyday work of the Company.In 2024, the Sustainability Department engaged an external consultant and leveraged input from employees, large customers, limited-income advocates, economic development groups, tribes, nonprofits, environmental non-governmental organizations, residential customers, and other stakeholders to identify and assess the sustainability issues that matter most. In total, 15 Priority Sustainability Issues (“PSIs”) were identified and prioritized. The top five issues that were prioritized by stakeholders are as follows: energy affordability, electric reliability, clean energy and decarbonization, workforce development, and climate resilience and adaptation. Understanding the sustainability priorities of internal and external stakeholders can help companies improve performance, identify risks and opportunities, and refine sustainability strategy. Finally, the Company maintains an annual Corporate Responsibility Report on the Pinnacle West website (www.pinnaclewest.com/corporate-responsibility). The report provides information related to the Company’s sustainability practices and performance. The information on Pinnacle West’s website, including the Corporate Responsibility Report, is not incorporated by reference into or otherwise a part of this report.Artificial IntelligenceTo address the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technology risks and opportunities, APS has developed a cross functional governance structure with leadership and experts from our information technology, cybersecurity, human resources, ethics, supply chain, legal, and nuclear generation teams. This cross functional structure assesses the opportunities and risks in alignment with enterprise strategy to ensure compliance with data security and reliability requirements as well as our Code of Ethical Conduct, while observing market trends in this rapidly evolving area.Regulatory OverviewAPS expects to file an application with the ACC for its next general rate case mid-year 2025 and is continuing to evaluate the timing of such filing.65Table of Contents 2022 Retail Rate CaseAPS filed an application with the ACC on October 28, 2022 (the “2022 Rate Case”) seeking an increase in annual retail base rates.On January 25, 2024, an Administrative Law Judge issued a ROO in the 2022 Rate Case, as corrected on February 6, 2024 (the “2022 Rate Case ROO”). The 2022 Rate Case ROO recommended, among other things, (i) a $523.1 million increase in the annual base rate revenue requirement, (ii) a 9.55% return on equity, (iii) a 0.25% return on the increment of fair value rate base greater than original cost, (iv) an effective fair value rate of return of 4.36%, (v) 12 months of post-test year plant and the inclusion of the Four Corners Effluent Limitations Guideline (“ELG”) project, (vi) the approval of APS’s System Reliability Benefit (“SRB”) proposal with certain procedural and other modifications, (vii) no additional Coal Community Transition (“CCT”) funding, (viii) a 5.0% return on the prepaid pension asset and a return of 5.35% on the OPEB liability, and (ix) no disallowances on APS’s coal contracts. The 2022 Rate Case ROO also recommended a number of changes to existing adjustors, including (i) the approval of modified DSM performance incentives and the requested DSM transfer to base rates, (ii) the retention of $1.9 million of Renewable Energy Adjustment Charge (“REAC”) in the adjustor rather than base rates, (iii) a partial transfer of $27.1 million of LFCR funds to base rates, and (iv) the adoption of an increase in the annual PSA cap to $0.006/kWh. On February 22, 2024, the ACC approved a number of amendments to the 2022 Rate Case ROO that resulted in, among other things, (i) an approximately $491.7 million increase in the annual base revenue requirement, (ii) a 9.55% return on equity, (iii) a 0.25% return on the increment of fair value rate base greater than original cost, (iv) an effective fair value rate of return of 4.39%, (v) a return set at the Company’s weighted average cost of capital on the net prepaid pension asset and net other post-employment benefit liability in rate base, (vi) an adjustment to generation maintenance and outage expense to reflect a more reasonable level of test year costs, (vii) approval of the SRB mechanism with modifications to customer notifications, procedural timelines and the inclusion of any qualifying technology and fuel source bid received through an ASRFP, and (viii) recovery of all DSM costs through the DSM Adjustment Charge (“DSMAC”) rather than through base rates.The ACC’s decision results in an expected total net annual revenue increase for APS of approximately $253.4 million and a roughly 8% increase to the typical residential customer’s bill. The ACC issued the final order for the 2022 Rate Case on March 5, 2024, with the new rates becoming effective for all service rendered on or after March 8, 2024.Six intervenors and the Attorney General of Arizona requested rehearing on various issues included in the ACC’s decision, such as the grid access charge (“GAC”) for solar customers, the SRB, and CCT funding. On April 15, 2024, the ACC granted, in part, the rehearing applications of the Attorney General, Arizona Solar Energy Industries Association, Solar Energy Industries Association, and Vote Solar specifically to review whether the GAC rate is just and reasonable, including whether it should be higher or lower, whether the GAC rate constitutes a discriminatory fee to solar customers, and whether omission of a GAC charge is discriminatory to non-solar customers. All other applications for rehearing were denied. A limited rehearing was held October 28 through November 1. Following the limited rehearing, an Administrative Law Judge issued a ROO (the “Limited Rehearing ROO”) on December 3, 2024. The Limited Rehearing ROO recommended affirming the GAC as just and reasonable and that the GAC is not discriminatory to solar customers and the absence of a GAC is not discriminatory to non-solar customers. On December 17, 2024, the ACC approved the Limited Rehearing ROO with an amendment that requires 66Table of Contents APS in its next rate case to propose a revenue allocation based on a site-load cost of service study in order to bring further parity in revenue collection between solar and non-solar customers. SEIA, AriSEIA, Vote Solar, the Arizona Attorney General, and two individual customers have filed requests for rehearing of the Commission’s December 17, 2024 decision on the rehearing. The Commission has taken no action on these requests. In addition, each of these parties have subsequently filed notices of appeal to the Arizona Court of Appeals seeking review of the Commission’s decisions regarding the GAC and on rehearing. APS cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings.2019 Retail Rate CaseOn October 31, 2019, APS filed an application with the ACC (the “2019 Rate Case”) for an annual increase in retail base rates. On August 2, 2021, an Administrative Law Judge issued a ROO in the 2019 Rate Case (the “2019 Rate Case ROO”) and issued corrections on September 10 and September 20, 2021. Subsequently, the ACC approved an amended 2019 Rate Case ROO on November 2, 2021. After the 2019 Rate Case decision, APS filed an application for rehearing of the 2019 Rate Case and later filed a Notice of Direct Appeal by APS at the Arizona Court of Appeals, requesting review of certain matters from the 2019 Rate Case decision. The Arizona Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part the ACC’s decision in the 2019 Rate Case, remanding the issue to the ACC for further proceedings. On June 14, 2023, APS and the ACC Legal Division filed a joint resolution with the ACC to allow recovery of $215.5 million in costs related to the installation of the Four Corners selective catalytic reduction (“SCR”) project, a reversal of the 20 basis points reduction to APS’s return on equity from 8.9% to 8.7% as a result of the 2019 Rate Case decision, and recovery of $59.6 million in revenue lost by APS between December 2021 and June 20, 2023. The joint resolution provides for a new Court Resolution Surcharge (“CRS”) mechanism, which is designed to recover the $59.6 million in revenue lost by APS between December 2021 and June 20, 2023, and the prospective recovery of ongoing costs related to the SCR investments and expense and the allowable return on equity difference in current base rates. On June 21, 2023, the ACC approved the joint resolution and proposals therein for recovery through the CRS mechanism, which became effective on July 1, 2023. As of December 31, 2024, $26.2 million of the $59.6 million of lost revenue has been recovered. Finally, the CRS tariff has been updated to account for changes to return on equity and depreciation and deferral adjustments approved in Decision No. 79293 in the 2022 Rate Case.Regulatory Lag DocketOn January 5, 2023, the ACC opened a new docket to explore the possibility of modifications to the ACC’s historical test year rules. The ACC requested comments and held two workshops exploring ways to reduce regulatory lag, including alternative ratemaking structures such as future test years, hybrid test years, and formula rates. On December 3, 2024, the ACC approved a policy statement regarding formula rate plans. The policy statement allows regulated utilities to propose formula rate plans in future rate cases. Proposed plans must be based on a historical test year, include an annual update with a true-up and an earnings test to ensure a utility earns within a 20 basis points band of its authorized return on equity. Proposed plans should also include an annual meeting and challenge periods for stakeholder feedback. Utilities that implement formula rates also must file a full rate case at least every five years unless an alternate schedule is set by the ACC. APS cannot predict the outcome of this matter.67Table of Contents ChollaOn August 14, 2024, APS filed a request with the ACC for a deferral order associated with unrecovered book value and closure costs of the remaining Cholla units. This order would authorize APS to defer, for future recovery in rates, both the expenses necessary to close and decommission coal-fired power plant infrastructure at Cholla, including legally required site environmental remediation, CCR corrective actions, the closure of CCR management facilities, and any unrecovered plant investment and operating costs incurred through and after April 2025. APS cannot predict the outcome of this matter.Fire MitigationOn August 14, 2024, APS filed a request with the ACC for a deferral order that would authorize APS to defer, for future recovery in rates, operations and maintenance expenses associated with wildfire management, including increased insurance costs. APS cannot predict the outcome of this matter.See Note 3 for information regarding additional regulatory matters.Captive Insurance Cell Pinnacle West is the primary beneficiary of a protected cell captive insurance company. The Captive provides insurance coverage to Pinnacle West and our subsidiaries that supplements third-party insurance policies. The Captive insures Pinnacle West and its subsidiaries for terrorism coverage, excess liability including certain wildfire coverage, excess property insurance, and excess employment practice liability. The Captive policies exclude nuclear liability at Palo Verde. See Note 10. The Captive may hold investment assets in cash, cash equivalents, and equity and fixed income instruments. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) significantly expands the availability of tax credits for investments in clean energy generation technologies and energy storage. Key provisions that are relevant to APS’s clean energy commitment include (i) an extension of tax credits for solar and wind generation, including a new option for solar investments to claim a Production Tax Credit (“PTC”) in lieu of the Investment Tax Credit (“ITC”) beginning in 2022; (ii) expansion of the ITC to cover stand-alone energy storage technology beginning in 2023; (iii) introduction of technology neutral clean energy ITCs and PTCs beginning in 2025; and (iv) introduction of a new PTC for nuclear energy produced by existing nuclear energy plants, available from 2024 through 2032. The Internal Revenue Service and U.S. Treasury Department have issued preliminary guidance related to various provisions of the IRA that have enabled APS to claim credits related to its solar and energy storage investments. The Company continues to await regulations and other guidance, including with respect to the nuclear PTC, which will provide additional details and clarifications regarding how the Company may be able to claim IRA tax credits. See Note 4 for more information. The prospects for federal tax reform, including potential modification or repeal of the IRA tax provisions, have increased due to the results of the 2024 election. Any such reform may impact the availability of future potential tax benefits from the IRA and could impact the Company’s effective tax rate, cash taxes paid and other financial results such as earnings per share, gross revenues, and cash flows. We cannot predict the timing or extent of such tax-related developments which, absent appropriate regulatory treatment, may have a negative impact on our financial results.68Table of Contents Financial Strength and FlexibilityPinnacle West and APS currently have ample borrowing capacity under their respective credit facilities and may readily access these facilities ensuring adequate liquidity for each company. Capital expenditures will be funded with internally generated cash and external financings, which may include issuances of long-term debt and Pinnacle West common stock.Other SubsidiariesPNW Power. On August 4, 2023, Pinnacle West entered into a purchase and sale agreement pursuant to which we agreed to sell all of our equity interest in our wholly-owned subsidiary BCE to Ameresco (the “BCE Sale”). The transaction was accounted for as the sale of a business and closed in multiple stages. The final closing of the BCE Sale was completed on January 12, 2024. See Note 20 for additional details. Certain investments and assets that BCE previously held, including the TransCanyon joint venture and holdings in the two Tenaska wind farm investments, were not included in the BCE Sale and were instead transferred to PNW Power, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pinnacle West.PNW Power’s investments include TransCanyon, a 50/50 joint venture that was formed in 2014 with BHE U.S. Transmission LLC, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company. TransCanyon is pursuing independent electric transmission opportunities within the 11 U.S. states that comprise the Western Interconnection, excluding opportunities related to transmission service that would otherwise be provided under the tariffs of the retail service territories of the venture partners’ utility affiliates. The U.S. Department of Energy’s Grid Deployment Office selected TransCanyon to enter into capacity contract negotiations for up to 25% of the Cross-Tie 500-kilovolt transmission line (“Cross-Tie”) as part of the Transmission Facilitation Program. The agreement was executed on June 12, 2024. The proposed Cross-Tie project includes a 214-mile transmission line connecting Utah and Nevada that is intended to help improve grid reliability and relieve congestion on other transmission lines.PNW Power’s investments also include minority ownership positions in two wind farms operated by Tenaska Energy, Inc. and Tenaska Energy Holdings, LLC, the 242 MW Clear Creek and the 250 MW Nobles 2 wind farms.

We closely monitor these factors to plan for the Company’s current needs, and to adjust our expectations, financial budgets and forecasts appropriately. Electric Operating Revenues. For the years 2022 through 2024, retail electric revenues comprised approximately 92% of our total operating revenues. Our electric operating revenues are affected by customer growth or decline, variations in weather from period to period, customer mix, average usage per customer and the impacts of energy efficiency programs, distributed energy additions, electricity rates and tariffs, the recovery of PSA deferrals and the operation of other recovery mechanisms. These revenue transactions are affected by the availability of excess generation or other energy resources and wholesale market conditions, including competition, demand, and prices. Actual and Projected Customer and Sales Growth. Retail customers in APS’s service territory increased 2.1% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared with the prior-year period. For the three years through 2024, APS’s customer growth averaged 2.1% per year. We currently project annual customer growth to be 1.5% to 2.5% for 2025 and the average annual growth to be in the range of 1.5% to 2.5% through 2027 based on anticipated steady population growth in Arizona during that period.Retail electricity sales in kWh, adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations, increased 5.7% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared with the prior-year period. While steady customer growth was somewhat offset by weaker usage among residential customers, energy savings driven by customer conservation, energy efficiency, and distributed renewable generation initiatives, the main drivers of positive sales for this period were continued strong sales to commercial and industrial customers and the ramp-up of new data center and large manufacturing customers.For the three years through 2024, annual retail electricity sales growth averaged 3.2%, adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations. Due to the expected growth of several large data centers and new large manufacturing facilities, we currently project that annual retail electricity sales in kWh will increase in the range of 4.0% to 6.0% for 2025 and that average annual growth will be in the range of 4.0% to 6.0% through 2027, including the effects of customer conservation, energy efficiency, and distributed renewable 70Table of Contents generation initiatives, but excluding the effects of weather variations.

(""we,"" ""our,"" ""us,"" the ""Company,"" or ""PROG Holdings"") is a financial technology holding company that provides transparent and competitive payment options to consumers. PROG Holdings has two reportable segments: (i) Progressive Leasing, an in-store, app-based, and e-commerce point-of-sale lease-to-own solutions provider; and (ii) Vive Financial (""Vive""), an omnichannel provider of second-look revolving credit products.Our Progressive Leasing segment provides consumers with lease-purchase solutions through its point-of-sale partner locations and e-commerce website partners (collectively, ""POS partners""). It does so by purchasing merchandise from the POS partners desired by customers and, in turn, leasing that merchandise to the customers through a cancellable lease-to-own transaction. Progressive Leasing has no stores of its own, but rather offers lease-purchase solutions to the customers of traditional and e-commerce retailers.Our Vive segment primarily serves customers that may not qualify for traditional prime lending offers who desire to purchase goods and services from participating merchants. Vive offers customized programs with services that include revolving loans through private label and Vive-branded credit cards. Vive's current network of POS partner locations and e-commerce websites includes furniture, mattresses, home exercise equipment, and home improvement retailers, as well as medical and dental service providers.Four Technologies, Inc. (""Four"") is a Buy Now, Pay Later (""BNPL"") company that allows shoppers to pay for merchandise through four interest-free installments. Four’s proprietary platform capabilities and its base of customers and retailers expand PROG Holdings’ ecosystem of financial technology offerings by introducing a payment solution that further diversifies the Company's consumer financial technology offerings. Shoppers use Four to purchase furniture, clothing, electronics, health and beauty products, footwear, jewelry, and other consumer goods from retailers across the United States. Four is not expected to be a reportable segment in 2025 as its financial results are not expected to be significant to the Company's consolidated financial results in 2025. Four's financial results are reported within ""Other"" for segment reporting purposes.PROG Holdings also owns Build, a credit building financial management tool. Build is not expected to be a reportable segment in 2025 as its financial results are not expected to be significant to the Company's consolidated financial results in 2025. Build's financial results are reported within ""Other"" for segment reporting purposes.Macroeconomic and Business EnvironmentProgressive Leasing entered the first quarter of 2025 with a larger lease portfolio, as measured by its gross leased asset balance, which resulted in an increase in revenues when compared to the first quarter of 2024. Despite the increase in demand for our lease-to-own offerings during 2024, the Company continues to operate in a challenging macroeconomic environment. For example, one of Progressive Leasing's major POS partners filed for bankruptcy in late 2024, resulting in the permanent closure of many of its stores. The loss of this POS partner resulted in an unfavorable impact on Progressive Leasing's GMV in the first quarter of 2025.22Progressive Leasing customer payment delinquencies were elevated at the end of 2024 and during the first quarter of 2025, which prompted us to tighten our decisioning posture to maintain a healthy lease portfolio. The higher delinquencies resulted in the provision for lease merchandise write-offs, as a percentage of lease revenues, increasing to 7.4% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 7.0% in the same period in 2024, but still within the Company's targeted annual range of 6% to 8%.Due to inflationary pressures in recent years, the cost of living remains significantly higher than it was prior to 2020, particularly with respect to housing, food and gas costs. We believe the increased cost of living has had a disproportionate negative effect on the customers we serve and an unfavorable impact on our GMV and financial performance in the first quarter of 2025. We believe the inflationary pressures, the cost of living and elevated interest rates for extended periods, coupled with uncertainty in the overall macroeconomic environment, including recent changes in tariff-related policies, also unfavorably impacted consumer confidence within our customer base, resulting in a decrease in demand for the types of merchandise offered by many of our key national and regional POS partners.HighlightsThe following summarizes significant financial highlights from the three months ended March 31, 2025:•We reported revenues of $684.1 million, which was a 6.6% increase compared to the $641.9 million we reported for the first quarter of 2024, as a result of a larger lease portfolio entering the first quarter of 2025.•GMV decreased by $16.6 million for Progressive Leasing and increased by $4.7 million for Vive in the first quarter of 2025, compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease in GMV for Progressive Leasing was due to the bankruptcy of a major POS partner in late 2024 and tightening of our decisioning posture. We believe the reduction in GMV was also driven by inflationary pressures, elevated cost of living, and an uncertain macroeconomic outlook, all of which have negatively impacted consumer confidence and demand for our lease-to-own offering when compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in GMV for Vive was due to the expansion of loan origination programs associated with Vive's national retail merchants. GMV from our Other operations increased by $71.1 million, due to an increase in Four loan originations in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the first quarter of 2024.•Earnings before income taxes increased to $47.2 million compared to $31.6 million in the same period in 2024. The increase was primarily driven by lower restructuring costs and increased revenues. The increase in earnings before income taxes was partially offset by increases in the provision for lease merchandise write-offs, provision for loan losses, and certain sales, general and administrative expenses.23Key Operating MetricsGross Merchandise Volume. We believe GMV is a key performance indicator of our Progressive Leasing and Vive segments, as it provides the total value of new leases and loans written into our portfolio over a specified time period. GMV does not represent revenues earned by the Company, but rather is a leading indicator we use in forecasting revenues the Company may earn in the short-term. Progressive Leasing's GMV is defined as the retail price of merchandise acquired by Progressive Leasing, which it then expects to lease to its customers. GMV for Vive and Other are defined as gross loan originations. The following table presents our GMV for the Company for the periods presented:Three Months Ended March 31,Change(In Thousands)20252024$%Progressive Leasing$401,962 $418,512 $(16,550)(4.0)%Vive36,272 31,602 4,670 14.8 Other119,863 48,791 71,072 145.7Total GMV$558,097 $498,905 $59,192 11.9 %Progressive Leasing's GMV decreased compared to the first quarter of 2024 due to the bankruptcy of a major POS partner in late 2024 and tightening of our decisioning posture. We believe the reduction in GMV was also driven by inflationary pressures, an elevated cost of living, and an uncertain macroeconomic outlook, all of which have negatively impacted consumer confidence and demand for our lease-to-own offering when compared to the same period in the prior year. E-commerce channels generated 16.8% of Progressive Leasing's GMV in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 16.3% in the first quarter of 2024. The increase in Vive's GMV was due to the expansion of loan origination programs associated with Vive's national retail merchants when compared to the same period in the prior year. GMV from Other increased due to an increase in Four loan originations.Active Customer Count. Our active customer count represents the total number of customers that have an active lease agreement with Progressive Leasing, or an active loan with Vive or our other operations. Active customer counts include customers that may have an active lease or loan agreement with more than one segment. The following table presents our active customer count for each segment and Other:As of March 31 (In Thousands)20252024Active Customer Count:Progressive Leasing828 819 Vive88 83 Other388 99 The number of active customers for Progressive Leasing and Vive was essentially flat compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in the number of customers for Other was the result of continued growth in Four and our other strategic businesses.24Key Components of Earnings Before Income Tax ExpenseIn this MD&A section, we review our condensed consolidated results. For the three months ended March 31, 2025 and the comparable prior year periods, some of the key revenue, cost and expense items that affected earnings before income taxes were as follows:Revenues. We separate our total revenues into two components: (i) lease revenues and fees and (ii) interest and fees on loans receivable. Lease revenues and fees include all revenues derived from lease agreements from our Progressive Leasing segment. Lease revenues are recorded net of a provision for uncollectible renewal payments. Interest and fees on loans receivable represents merchant fees, finance charges and annual and other fees earned on outstanding loans in our Vive segment and, to a lesser extent, from Four and our other strategic businesses.Depreciation of Lease Merchandise. Depreciation of lease merchandise reflects the expense associated with depreciating merchandise leased to customers by Progressive Leasing.Provision for Lease Merchandise Write-offs. The provision for lease merchandise write-offs represents the estimated merchandise losses incurred but not yet identified by management and adjustments for changes in estimates for the allowance for lease merchandise write-offs.Operating Expenses. Operating expenses include personnel costs, the provision for loan losses, restructuring expenses, sales acquisition expense, computer software expense, stock-based compensation expense, intangible asset amortization, professional services expense, advertising, bank service charges, fixed asset depreciation, occupancy costs, and decisioning expense, among other expenses.Interest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net consists of interest incurred on the Company's Senior Notes and senior secured revolving credit facility (the ""Revolving Facility""). Interest expense is presented net of interest income earned on the Company's deposits in cash and cash equivalents. 25Results of Operations – Three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 Three Months Ended March 31,Change(In Thousands)20252024$%REVENUES:Lease Revenues and Fees$651,557 $620,550 $31,007 5.0 %Interest and Fees on Loans Receivable32,531 21,320 11,211 52.6 684,088 641,870 42,218 6.6 COSTS AND EXPENSES:Depreciation of Lease Merchandise460,443 431,571 28,872 6.7 Provision for Lease Merchandise Write-Offs48,018 43,141 4,877 11.3 Operating Expenses119,306 127,341 (8,035)(6.3)627,767 602,053 25,714 4.3 OPERATING PROFIT56,321 39,817 16,504 41.4 Interest Expense, Net(9,090)(8,250)(840)10.2 EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAX EXPENSE47,231 31,567 15,664 49.6 INCOME TAX EXPENSE12,513 9,601 2,912 30.3 NET EARNINGS$34,718 $21,966 $12,752 58.1 %RevenuesInformation about our revenues by source and reportable segment is as follows: Three Months Ended March 31, 2025Three Months Ended March 31, 2024(In Thousands)Progressive LeasingViveOtherTotalProgressive LeasingViveOtherTotalLease Revenues and Fees$651,557 $— $— $651,557 $620,550 $— $— $620,550 Interest and Fees on Loans Receivable— 15,660 16,871 32,531 — 16,051 5,269 21,320 Total $651,557 $15,660 $16,871 $684,088 $620,550 $16,051 $5,269 $641,870 The increase in Progressive Leasing revenues was primarily due to a larger lease portfolio entering the period, as measured by its gross leased asset balance, resulting from the 9.1% increase in GMV for the fourth quarter of 2024 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Progressive Leasing revenues also increased due to higher early buyouts in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same quarter in 2024. Vive revenues declined slightly due to a smaller loan portfolio entering the first quarter of 2025 as compared to the first quarter of 2024. The increase to Other revenue was primarily driven by an increase in Four's GMV as compared to the same period in 2024, due to increased loan originations.26Operating ExpensesInformation about certain significant components of operating expenses for the first quarter of 2025 as compared to the first quarter of 2024 is as follows: Three Months Ended March 31,Change(In Thousands)20252024$%Personnel Costs1$45,156 $44,705 $451 1.0 %Stock-Based Compensation7,902 6,642 1,260 19.0 Occupancy Costs895 1,367 (472)(34.5)Advertising4,158 3,694 464 12.6 Professional Services9,640 6,546 3,094 47.3 Sales Acquisition Expense28,257 7,905 352 4.5 Computer Software Expense37,547 7,287 260 3.6 Bank Service Charges2,958 2,952 6 0.2 Other Sales, General and Administrative Expense12,303 9,162 3,141 34.3 Sales, General and Administrative Expense98,816 90,260 8,556 9.5 Provision for Loan Losses14,362 11,049 3,313 30.0 Depreciation and Amortization6,122 8,018 (1,896)(23.6)Restructuring Expense6 18,014 (18,008)(100.0)Operating Expenses$119,306 $127,341 $(8,035)(6.3)%1 Personnel costs excludes stock-based compensation expense, which is reported separately in the operating expense table.2 Sales acquisition expense includes vendor incentives and rebates to POS partners (excluding retailer marketing and development initiatives), external sales commissions, amortization of initial direct costs and amounts paid to various POS partners to be their exclusive provider of lease-to-own solutions.3 Computer software expense consists primarily of software subscription fees, licensing fees and non-capitalizable software implementation costs.Professional services increased $3.1 million compared to the same period in 2024, primarily due to a $3.0 million increase at Progressive Leasing resulting from higher technology-related costs and an increase in legal costs. Professional services also increased $0.1 million at Vive.Other sales, general and administrative expense increased $3.1 million compared to the same period in 2024, primarily due to a $2.8 million increase within our Other operations, due to higher processing fees from our continued GMV growth at Four and our other strategic operating expenses.Provision for loan losses increased $3.3 million compared to the same period in 2024. The increase was primarily the result of a $2.6 million increase in the provision for loan losses for our Other operations, due to the continued growth of our Four business and our other strategic operations. The provision for loan losses at Vive also increased $0.7 million resulting from a higher allowance for loan receivable losses primarily driven by uncertainty in the overall macroeconomic environment.Restructuring expense decreased $18.0 million at Progressive Leasing compared to the same period in 2024. In 2025, there were no new restructuring activities and the expense was not significant. For the same period in 2024, restructuring costs included $7.8 million associated with the early termination of an independent sales agent agreement, $6.0 million of operating lease right-of-use asset and other fixed asset impairment charges related to the reduction of Progressive Leasing office space, $4.1 million of employee severance within Progressive Leasing and $0.1 million of other restructuring costs.Other Costs and ExpensesDepreciation of lease merchandise. Depreciation of lease merchandise increased by 6.7% during the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. The increase was primarily due to growth in the Company's lease portfolio entering the first quarter of 2025. As a percentage of lease revenues and fees, depreciation of lease merchandise increased to 70.7% from 69.5% in the prior year quarter, primarily due to a higher level of early buyouts during the three months ended March 31, 2025 as compared to the same period in 2024.27Provision for lease merchandise write-offs. The provision for lease merchandise write-offs increased $4.9 million compared to the same period in 2024. The provision for lease merchandise write-offs as a percentage of lease revenues increased to 7.4% during the first quarter of 2025 from 7.0% in the same period in 2024. The increase was due to higher write-offs and delinquencies in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. Given the significant economic uncertainty resulting from persistent inflationary pressures, increased interest rates for an extended period, and/or the impact of tariffs, and the potential effects of such developments on Progressive Leasing's POS partners, customers, and business going forward, a high level of estimation was involved in determining the allowance as of March 31, 2025. Actual lease merchandise write-offs could differ materially from the allowance for those write-offs.Interest expense, net.

Factors impacting the change in earnings before income taxes for each reporting segment are discussed above.Income Tax ExpenseIncome tax expense increased to $12.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to $9.6 million in the prior year comparable period, primarily due to higher earnings before income tax expense. The effective income tax rate was 26.5% for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to 30.4% for the same period in 2024. The decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily the result of discrete income tax expense in 2024 related to uncertain tax position liabilities.28Overview of Financial PositionThe major changes in the condensed consolidated balance sheet from December 31, 2024 to March 31, 2025 include: •Cash and cash equivalents increased $117.6 million to $213.3 million during the three months ended March 31, 2025. For additional information, refer to the ""Liquidity and Capital Resources"" section below.•Accounts receivable, net of allowances, decreased $13.6 million primarily due to a 32.7% decrease in Progressive Leasing's GMV for the first quarter of 2025 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2024 and seasonally higher customer payment trends in the first quarter.•Lease merchandise, net of accumulated depreciation and allowances, decreased $124.8 million due primarily to a 32.7% decrease in Progressive Leasing's GMV for the first quarter of 2025 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2024. Seasonally higher exercises of early buyouts during the first quarter also contributed to the decrease.•Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased $17.6 million primarily due to a $20.9 million increase to income taxes payable as compared to December 31, 2024.•Debt, net decreased $49.7 million due to repayment in January 2025 of the $50.0 million balance that was outstanding on the Revolving Facility as of December 31, 2024.29Liquidity and Capital ResourcesGeneralWe expect that our primary capital requirements will consist of:•Reinvesting in our business, including buying merchandise for the operations of Progressive Leasing. Because we believe Progressive Leasing will continue to grow over the long-term, we expect that the need for additional lease merchandise will remain a major capital requirement; •Making merger and acquisition investment(s) to further broaden our product offerings; and•Returning excess cash to shareholders through periodically repurchasing stock and/or paying dividends.Other capital requirements include (i) expenditures related to software development; (ii) expenditures related to our corporate operating activities; (iii) personnel expenditures; (iv) income tax payments; (v) funding of loans receivable for Vive and Four; and (vi) servicing our outstanding debt obligations. Our capital requirements have been financed through:•cash flows from operations;•private debt offerings;•bank debt; and•stock offerings.As of March 31, 2025, the Company had $213.3 million of cash, $350.0 million of availability under the Revolving Facility, and $600.0 million of gross indebtedness.Cash Provided by Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities was $209.9 million and $135.7 million during the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The $74.2 million increase in operating cash flows was primarily due to an increase in cash received from exercises of early lease buyout options, a $15.2 million decrease in cash paid for lease merchandise, and a $7.6 million decrease in cash payments on accounts payable and accrued expenses. Operating cash flows were negatively impacted by a $4.1 million increase in cash paid for taxes when compared to the same period in 2024. Other changes in cash provided by operating activities are discussed above in our discussion of results for the three months ended March 31, 2025.Cash Used in Investing ActivitiesCash used in investing activities was $4.1 million and $3.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The $0.5 million increase in investing cash outflows was primarily the result of an $88.9 million increase in cash investments in loans receivable due mainly to growth in Four loan originations. This increase in loan originations was partially offset by a $88.3 million increase in proceeds from loans receivable, primarily due to an increase in Four loan repayments.Cash Used in Financing ActivitiesCash used in financing activities was $88.2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to $34.7 million during the same period in 2024. Cash used in financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2025 was primarily for the repayment of $50.0 million that was drawn on our revolving credit facility during the fourth quarter of 2024, $26.1 million for share repurchases and $5.3 million paid for cash dividends. Cash used in financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2024 consisted of no debt repayment, $24.4 million of share repurchases and $5.2 million paid for cash dividends.30Share RepurchasesWe purchase our stock in the market from time to time as authorized by our Board of Directors. Effective February 21, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors reauthorized the repurchase of Company common stock at an aggregate purchase price of up to $500 million under the Company's existing share repurchase program, with such reauthorized share repurchase program to be extended for a period of three years from February 21, 2024, or until the $500 million aggregate purchase price of Company common stock purchased pursuant to the reauthorized share repurchase program has been met, whichever occurs first.The Company repurchased 935,992 shares for $26.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2025. That amount does not include any excise tax that may be assessed on those repurchases. As of March 31, 2025, we had the authority to purchase additional shares up to our remaining authorization limit of $335.2 million.DividendsOn February 26, 2025, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.13 per share of outstanding common stock, which was paid on March 25, 2025. Aggregate dividend payments during the three months ended March 31, 2025 were $5.3 million. While we expect to continue paying quarterly cash dividends in future periods, the future payment of dividends, if permitted, will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our capital allocation strategy at that time as well as other factors, including our earnings, financial condition, and other considerations that our Board of Directors deems relevant.Debt FinancingOn November 24, 2020, the Company entered into a credit agreement with a consortium of lenders providing for a $350.0 million senior revolving credit facility (the ""Revolving Facility""). On November 15, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment to the Revolving Facility, the primary purpose of which was to extend the maturity date of the Revolving Facility from November 24, 2025 to November 15, 2029.The Revolving Facility includes an uncommitted incremental facility increase option (""Incremental Facilities"") which, subject to certain terms and conditions, permits the Company at any time prior to the maturity date to request an increase in extensions of credit available thereunder by an aggregate additional principal amount of up to $300.0 million. As of March 31, 2025, the Company had no outstanding balance and $350.0 million remaining available for borrowings on the Revolving Facility.The Revolving Facility is fully secured and contains certain financial covenants, which include requirements that the Company maintain ratios of (i) total net debt to EBITDA of no more than 2.50:1.00 and (ii) consolidated interest coverage of no less than 3.00:1.00. The Company will be in default under the Revolving Facility if it fails to comply with these covenants, and all borrowings outstanding may become due immediately. As of March 31, 2025, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants set forth in the Revolving Facility and believes it will continue to be in compliance in the future.On November 26, 2021, the Company entered into an indenture in connection with its offering of $600 million aggregate principal amount of its senior unsecured notes due 2029 (the ""Senior Notes""). The Senior Notes were issued at 100.0% of their par value with a stated fixed annual interest rate of 6.00%. Interest accrues on the outstanding balance and is payable semi-annually. The Senior Notes are general unsecured obligations of the Company and are guaranteed by certain of the Company's existing and future domestic subsidiaries. The indenture discussed above contains various other covenants and obligations to which the Company and its subsidiaries are subject while the Senior Notes are outstanding. The covenants in the indenture may limit the extent to which, or the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to, among other things: (i) incur additional debt and guarantee debt; (ii) pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem capital stock; (iii) prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt; (iv) issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities; (v) make loans and investments; (vi) sell assets; (vii) incur liens; (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates; (ix) enter into agreements restricting the ability of the Company’s subsidiaries to pay dividends; and (x) consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of the Company’s assets. The indenture also contains customary events of default for transactions of this type and amount. The Company was in compliance with these covenants at March 31, 2025 and believes that it will continue to be in compliance in the future. CommitmentsIncome TaxesDuring the three months ended March 31, 2025, we made net tax payments of $0.3 million. Within the next nine months, we anticipate making estimated tax payments of $80.2 million for United States federal income taxes and state income taxes.31Deferred income tax liabilities as of March 31, 2025 were $64.4 million. Deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their respective book basis, which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the liabilities are settled at their reported financial statement amounts. The results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods.LeasesWe lease management and information technology space for corporate functions under operating leases expiring at various times through 2028. Our corporate and segment management office leases contain renewal options for additional periods ranging from three to five years.Contractual Obligations and CommitmentsFuture interest payments on the Company's variable-rate debt are based on a rate per annum equal to, at our option, (i) the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR"") plus a margin within the range of 1.5% to 2.5% for revolving loans, based on total leverage, or (ii) the administrative agent's base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.5% to 1.5%, as specified in the agreement. Future interest payments related to our Revolving Facility are based on the borrowings outstanding at that time and may be different depending on future borrowing activity and interest rates. The Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Facility as of March 31, 2025.On November 26, 2021, the Company issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes that bear a fixed annual interest rate of 6.0%. Interest accrues on the outstanding balance and is payable semi-annually. The Senior Notes will mature on November 15, 2029.The Company has no long-term commitments to purchase merchandise nor does it have significant purchase agreements that specify minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months.Unfunded Lending CommitmentsThe Company, through its Vive business, had unconditionally cancellable unfunded lending commitments totaling approximately $459.8 million and $461.1 million as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively, that do not give rise to revenues and cash flows. These unfunded commitments arise in the ordinary course of business from credit card agreements with individual cardholders that give them the ability to borrow, against unused amounts, up to the maximum credit limit assigned to their account. While these unfunded amounts represented the total available unused lines of credit, the Company does not anticipate that all cardholders will utilize their entire available line at any given point in time. Commitments to extend unsecured credit are agreements to lend to a cardholder so long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.Critical Accounting PoliciesRefer to the 2024 Annual Report.Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements.",33822,mgmt,20250423,2025,10Q,real_textdata_2025
