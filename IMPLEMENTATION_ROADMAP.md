# McGill-FIAM Hackathon: Detailed Implementation Roadmap

## Executive Summary
Based on analysis of current implementation, we have:
- ✅ **Data Infrastructure**: Complete cleaning pipeline with parquet output
- ✅ **Layer 1**: Utilities sector fully implemented (MA/MOM/GARCH)
- 🔄 **Layer 2**: ML templates exist, need integration with Layer 1
- ❌ **Layer 3**: Text processing not started
- 🔄 **Layer 4**: Portfolio framework exists, needs meta-learning

## Phase 1: Complete Layer 1 (All Sectors) [Priority: HIGH]

### 1.1 Sector Configuration & Implementation
**Status**: Only utilities (GICS 55) completed, 10 other sectors empty

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Clone utilities structure to all sectors with sector-specific parameters
- [ ] Implement GICS-aware parameter tuning per implementation.md guidelines:
  - **Defensive** (Utilities 55, Staples 30): MA_WINDOW=60-90d, MOM_LAG=120-180d
  - **Cyclical** (IT 45, Discretionary 25): MA_WINDOW=20-40d, MOM_LAG=60-90d
  - **Others**: Intermediate parameters based on sector characteristics

**Improvement**: Add sector volatility regime detection - adjust GARCH windows dynamically

### 1.2 Enhanced Candidate Selection Logic
**Current**: Basic indicator computation only

**Enhancements**:
- [ ] Implement sector-aware ranking system (top-K/bottom-K selection)
- [ ] Add risk filtering: illiquidity flags, micro-cap exclusion, volatility band constraints
- [ ] Implement turnover penalty scoring to reduce transaction costs
- [ ] Cross-sector balancing to maintain ~2-3x final portfolio size

### 1.3 Performance & Caching
- [ ] Monthly aggregation and caching system (daily → monthly snapshots)
- [ ] Parallel processing across all sectors simultaneously
- [ ] Partitioned parquet output by sector and year-month

## Phase 2: Integrate & Enhance Layer 2 (ML Pipeline) [Priority: HIGH]

### 2.1 Data Integration Architecture
**Current**: Standalone ML template, no Layer 1 integration

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Build data fusion pipeline: Layer 1 signals + 147 characteristics
- [ ] Implement strict temporal alignment (month-end t → t+1 prediction)
- [ ] Create expanding window training with rolling validation (2005-2012 train, 2013-2014 val, 2015+ OOS)

### 2.2 Enhanced ML Framework
**Current**: Basic LASSO/Ridge implementation

**Improvements**:
- [ ] Add ensemble methods: XGBoost/LightGBM with temporal validation
- [ ] Implement feature importance tracking and selection
- [ ] Add non-linear interaction terms between Layer 1 signals and factors
- [ ] Monthly hyperparameter optimization with 1-year lock-in periods

### 2.3 Model Selection & Validation
- [ ] Implement proper OOS R² calculation (competition definition)
- [ ] Add model performance monitoring and drift detection
- [ ] Implement prediction confidence intervals
- [ ] Cross-validation specifically for time series (blocked/purged)

## Phase 3: Implement Layer 3 (Text Analysis) [Priority: MEDIUM]

### 3.1 Text Data Infrastructure
**Status**: Not started (~30GB 10-K/10-Q filings available)

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Build CIK ↔ gvkey mapping system
- [ ] Implement filing date validation (only t-available filings)
- [ ] Extract MD&A and Risk Factors sections efficiently

### 3.2 Feature Engineering Pipeline
**Approach**: Lightweight, production-ready features

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Sentence embeddings: FinBERT/MPNet for semantic features
- [ ] Traditional NLP features: sentiment, tone, uncertainty scores
- [ ] Keyword extraction: litigation, forward-looking statements
- [ ] Temporal aggregation to firm-month level

### 3.3 Integration Strategy
- [ ] Option A: Augment Layer 2 features directly
- [ ] Option B: Secondary model with prediction blending
- [ ] **Stretch**: Fundamental prediction (ROA, EBIT/Sales) as intermediate features

## Phase 4: Neural Meta-Learning & Portfolio Construction [Priority: HIGH]

### 4.1 Meta-Learning Architecture
**Current**: Basic portfolio analysis template

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement stacking/blending of Layer 2 and Layer 3 predictions
- [ ] Small MLP meta-learner (freeze on validation, score OOS)
- [ ] Prediction calibration (Platt/Isotonic scaling)
- [ ] Temporal stability monitoring

### 4.2 Advanced Portfolio Construction
**Current**: Basic decile ranking

**Enhancements**:
- [ ] Risk-adjusted position sizing with volatility targeting
- [ ] Sector/country neutrality constraints
- [ ] Position size caps (e.g., 1% max weight)
- [ ] Transaction cost modeling and turnover penalties

### 4.3 Performance Analytics
- [ ] Comprehensive attribution: alpha vs S&P 500, factor exposures
- [ ] Risk metrics: Sharpe, Information Ratio, max drawdown, VaR
- [ ] Transaction cost analysis and turnover optimization
- [ ] Regime-aware performance analysis

## Phase 5: Production & Optimization [Priority: MEDIUM]

### 5.1 Infrastructure Improvements
- [ ] Dockerized execution environment
- [ ] Automated backtesting pipeline with walk-forward validation
- [ ] Model performance monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Data quality checks and validation

### 5.2 Research Extensions
- [ ] Alternative data integration (sentiment, news, satellite data)
- [ ] Regime-switching models for parameter adaptation
- [ ] ESG scoring integration
- [ ] Cryptocurrency/alternative asset extension

## Phase 6: Deliverables & Documentation [Priority: HIGH]

### 6.1 Competition Requirements
- [ ] OOS R² calculation over 2015-2025 period
- [ ] 5-page executive presentation deck
- [ ] Clean, commented code repository
- [ ] Performance attribution and risk analysis

### 6.2 Quality Assurance
- [ ] Code review and refactoring
- [ ] Comprehensive testing suite
